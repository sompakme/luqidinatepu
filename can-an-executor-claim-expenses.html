Each case will depend on the specific circumstances as to whether the executor acted reasonably.<h2>What is the executor of a will entitled to?</h2>In other words, an executor's powers arise from the will and not from the grant of probate. Therefore, a sole executor or, where there is more than one executor, all executors jointly, subject to adequate verification of identity, are entitled to the original will from the date of death.<h2>Do executors have to open a bank account?</h2>The obligation of executors is only that a bank current account should be opened in the name of the executor (or administrator in the case of an Intestacy), but designated to show that it is on behalf of the estate of the deceased.<h2>Can an executor decide who gets what?</h2>No. The Executor cannot decide who gets what .
