My former colleague getting fired had nothing to do with me trying to get my friend hired,” France, a co-host and fashion expert on the series, said in a<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/C4QbkEhAa5j/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Friday Instagram post.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Rumors and accusations have flown since interior designer Berk left the series and news broke he would be replaced by Jeremiah Brent for the ninth season of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/queer-eye-turns-20-scout-production-company-projects-1235514708/>Queer Eye</a> after an alleged campaign led by France.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">France, who fronts the style portion of the series, insists Netflix did its own casting for Berk’s replacement and without his campaigning for Brent, as he is accused of doing. “I didn’t prop my friend up for the job. They ended up getting it because they were the best person for the job. Am I so happy that they have the job? Uh-huh! I really am, I think they’re going to be incredible on the show. But I didn’t get them hired by getting rid of somebody else,” France said dismissively.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He added the media storm around Berk’s departure was prompted by little more than a rumor mill. “This all started because of a comment on a gossip blog. That just got reposted and reposted, and then it almost became gospel. So, from the horse’s mouth, I’m telling you, that that’s not at all how it all went down. That’s all I have to say on the matter. You need to dig deeper, if you still don’t believe me, so be it, but that’s it,” France said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Representatives for Berk declined to comment on France’s social media post. On Friday, Berk also posted on his X, formerly Twitter, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://twitter.com/bobbyberk/status/1766130811382714434>account a video</a> of former first lady Michelle Obama’s insisting “When they go low, we go high!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrZinZZanrq%2BvxGaorp2Vp3qmxcRmmKWklZyutbXOp6pmmp%2BXr7p5wZ6ppGVhZ4B2hJNvcGtwXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
