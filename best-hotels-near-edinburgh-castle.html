You can take it all in from Princes Street (also known as shoppingcentral), or perched above the Royal Mile with Greyfriars Bobby, St Giles Cathedral and picture-perfect Victoria Street mere steps away. You’ll find rooms with views in all these hotels, from the stylishly simple to luxurious budget-busters. Come for the Festival or at Hogmanay and you’ll getall that and fireworks, too. Here's our pick of the best hotels near Edinburgh Castle, featuring the top places to stay for romantic restaurants, elegant rooms, cosy bars and stylish interiors, near Waverley Station and the Royal Mile.</p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This imposing and historic building in the heart of the city offers a modern take on the grand hotel: think doormen in top hats and afternoon teas alongside first-class connectivity, a fitness centre (with swimming pool and Guerlain spa) and impeccably refurbished rooms. Splash out on a Castle View room for a heart-swelling outlook on life in Edinburgh. The drinking and dining spots abound, from Pompadour by Galvin, the prettiest dining room in the city (think of a box of pastel macarons), to Peacock Alley – in the old station ticket office – which is a big, bright but surprisingly intimate setting for coffee, a cocktail, or a multi-tiered afternoon tea (you’ll never forget an Iru Bru scone). <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>171</span></span><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An insider guide to Edinburgh</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>The only five-star hotel on the Royal Mile, located between the George IV Bridge and the photogenic charms of Victoria Street. For a hotel with 136 rooms it feels nicely personal – the emphasis here is on the hotel as a destination with a show-off bar and an unusually un-Italian Italian restaurant helping things along – and guests are invited to linger and enjoy the sexy, relaxed vibe firmly established in the candlelit lobby. Interiors make great use of the clear light and unexpectedly terrific views (the best view of Edinburgh Castle is from room 507). It’s a five-minute stroll up the Royal Mile to the castle. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=#>best spa hotels in Scotland</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>The Hotel du Vin group is known for its imaginative use of historically interesting buildings and this branch in the Old Town – close to the old Royal Infirmary and well-placed for exploring – is no exception. It is intriguingly located in an 18th-century former asylum, and carefully mixes original features with a sleek modernity. Rooms come in seven categories, from Standard double or twin to Executive suite, and all except Standards have decadent freestanding baths. Elsewhere, the mezzanine-level bar is convivial, great for people-watching and offers over a dozen wines by the glass plus wine list to suit all budgets. The restaurant serves appetising and seasonal bistro fare. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>112</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=#>most romantic hotels in Edinburgh</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This big, glossy, corporate hotel is located just off the west end of Princes Street, directly opposite the magnificent Usher Hall, Edinburgh castle rising up behind and Arthur’s Seat lurking in the background. You can walk to the Old Town via the Grassmarket in 10 minutes and you’ve only a five-minute stroll from shopping on Princes Street. The location, range of rooms and services, luxurious spa and well-regarded restaurant (think parsnip tart with cumin ice cream) make it the perfect choice for travellers who like to know exactly what they’re getting. Service is seamlessly efficient but warmly sincere from beginning to end. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>142</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=#>best Edinburgh hotels with spas</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>A budget hotel with a terrific position on Princes Street and a strong design identity, as per the German Motel One brand. Here, that means an identity that is bold, distinctive and slightly bonkers. Rooms are pleasingly minimal, with white walls and accents of turquoise and dark brown but don’t expect a cushioned headboard or even more than one pillow per person (but do expect a really comfortable king-sized bed and powerful shower). Book a front-facing room for views of the castle. Public areas are stylish, fun and functional: the One Lounge has a bar offering a decent choice of drinks and snacks, along with great views across Princes Street to the Old Town. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>99</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=#>best Scottish castle hotels</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This city-centre hotel is not on the most salubrious-looking street in Edinburgh, but it’s in a central location close to the Grassmarket, with a great view of the imposing south side of the castle, and good restaurants nearby too (including The Timberyard and Castle Terrace). Although strongly corporate, the welcome is as genuinely warm as the complimentary cookie handed out on arrival, while the more stylish bar and restaurant areas make up for regimentally uniform but convincingly comfortable bedrooms. There is a strong focus on the working traveller with a business centre, 24-hour fitness suite and round-the-clock room service. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>102</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=#>best hotels in Edinburgh</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This former Royal Mile bank – a scaled-down layer cake of classical stone with colonnade and pediment – has been successfully converted into a lively pub with unexpectedly serene hotel rooms above. It's on one of the busiest locations in the city – the corner of the Bridges and the Royal Mile, which is a great location for sightseeing if you want to be in the thick of things. There is no lounge for guests' use, but the pub downstairs is always lively, with quiz nights, jam sessions and live bands. The breakfast menu is short and straightforward, the main menu has fairly predictable staples and the occasional Scottish reference. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>123</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=#>best budget hotels in Edinburgh</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This extraordinary collection of fantasy suites near Edinburgh Castle is the ultimate romantic hideaway: sumptuous, indulgent, and slightly (delightfully) mad with jewel-coloured velvets, silks and brocades, carved wood, gilding and candle-light. Beds are dramatically draped or four-postered (or both); chin-deep bateau baths are perfect for sharing. Two dining rooms form the restaurant: the original Witchery – all painted ceilings, dark oak panelling and red leather, and the lighter but equally striking Secret Garden with its elegant wall of arched French windows overlooking a hidden terrace – deeply romantic on a summer's evening. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>495</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=#>best hotels in Scotland</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>Although this neo-Renaissance building has been an Edinburgh landmark for more than a century, there's nothing old-fashioned about this Forte flagship. Luxurious bedrooms with over-the-top marble bathrooms (the most expensive of which look out over Princes Street, the castle and Arthur’s Seat), a Michelin-starred restaurant, lavish afternoon teas in the Palm Court and a spacious spa with a swimming pool all add up to a sophisticated 21st-century version of a truly grand hotel. Original features including the sweeping staircases, classical columns and royal icing plasterwork have been complimented by designer Olga Polizzi's interior design wand. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>265</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=#>best hotels in Edinburgh city centre</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>A mid-range chain hotel with a keen sense of style and a cracking Princes Street location. The bar, restaurant and rooms at the front have splendid views of the Old Town and, if you look to your right, a pretty good view of the castle. The 61 rooms and three suites are an entertaining take on clubby traditional meets contemporary design. Minibars have complimentary water, juice and snacks and bathrooms have a faintly Art Deco feel. The Juniper Cocktail Bar is bright and buzzy, leading into a quieter area with inviting high back chairs, perfect for a quiet loll. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>125</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=#>best five-star hotels in Edinburgh</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This design-led, castle-view hotel in Edinburgh brings both style and substance to a great city-centre location. It’s sleek, it’s sensuously simple, it’s downright sexy. No cookie-cutter thinking here: modern design complements the local vernacular, from the sandstone exterior to the sliding oak shutters. And it isn’t design sacrificing function – everything works as well as it looks. The only drawback? The temptation to sip Champagne all day drinking in the Nor’loft’s views until it’s time to retreat to the zen-like sanctuary of your slickly stylish bedroom. For all that stylish sophistication, service is delivered with winning warmth from enthusiastic staff. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>143</span></span><p><i>Contributions by Rachel Cranshaw</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6dnKysmaOutbXOp6ponaWnvLGxjq6loqyVmXqstc2gm6ilX6iwsMDLmqWdZ5WZtq%2Bu1KueoWeRp8Gqr8ueqmialajBbrTOrZylq12jsqK%2BjJ6boqaSqr%2BotIycmKysnJp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
