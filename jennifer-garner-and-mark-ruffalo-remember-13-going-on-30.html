In the clip, the two sit together on a striped cream-colored couch, a nod to the final scene of the 2004 film in which their newlywed characters relax on a sofa outside their house.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Can you believe it's been 18 years since 13 Going On 30?" Garner asks Ruffalo before pulling out a pack of Razzles, the candy that was famously featured in the movie. "Which is about how old these Razzles are," she says. "Both a candy—"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"And a gum," Ruffalo adds, finishing the film's quote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In The Adam Project, Ruffalo and Garner play married couple Louis and Ellie Reed, the parents of young Adam Reed, played by Walker Scobell.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the promo, Ruffalo reflects on the similarities between their new characters and their 13 Going On 30 characters, Jenna Rink and Matt Flamhaff. "It's sorta like Jenna and Matty got together so that they could become parents in The Adam Project," he says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Scobell then joins his onscreen parents. "You guys look cozy. What's going on?" he asks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We're just sitting here reminiscing how we're both in 13 Going On 30," Ruffalo replies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Garner asks if he's watched the movie, Scobell answers, "Didn't that movie come out, like, forever ago? Like, before I was even born, I think. But if you were 30 when you filmed it, then that means you're—"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Older than you," Ruffalo retorts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Earlier this week, Garner shared nearly identical stills from 13 Going On 30 and The Adam Project, with both photos featuring the duo in the same cozy-sofa pose.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"13 Going On 30 Reunion, aka #TheAdamProject, is out Friday on @netflix. ♥️," she captioned the photos.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
