While it doesn't seem like there's ever been direct contact between both artists, the tension between them has been in the air since last year. It's arguable their beef played a factor in XXXTENTACION rise to fame, neither have really buried the hatchet. Earlier this morning, X seemed to have taken some sort of shots at Drake but he later backtracked and claimed that he was hacked.</p><p>Earlier today, XXXTENTACION&nbsp;social media accounts shared some questionable&nbsp;posts directed at Drake. Initially, there was a photo of man who looked like Drake performing fellatio. The post was taken down but X's Instagram story had another claim thats said Drake was trying to kill him.</p><p>"IF ANYONE TRIES TO KILL ME IT WAS @champagnepapi IM SNITCHING RN," he wrote.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/BfmtjJ5lutj</a><br></p><p>However, after all of these were deleted, he attempted to clear the air by saying he was hacked.</p><p>"Please stop entertaining that bullshit on Twitter, my accounts were previously hacked." He wrote on his IG story.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfm3oIYlVNn</a><br></p><p>Drake and XXXTENTACION's issues with each other seemed to be reignited after the video for "God's Plan" dropped and Drizzy challenged his followers to do a good deed for someone. Many took it as Drake stealing X's #HelpingHandChallenge. Regardless, both of them have denied that they have any problems with each other over that.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhZn95gJNmr7GwpJq7ta3CoqanZaOWxrR5x6KqZqufmLaiuIymnJ2hkWLEor%2BMoZico5WZeqKy056pZqukp66vs8Rmm6uZm5p6sbvSrapmppWswA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
