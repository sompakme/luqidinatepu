McEntire addressed how her path to success didn't come quickly.&nbsp;"Baby steps, slow burn,"&nbsp;McEntire shared with host Willie Geist, describing her start in music. "Yeah, I thought once you had a record on the radio, you're rich. You know you have a tour bus, a big mansion. No, I was living in a $10-a-month rent house in Oklahoma. Had to haul our own water,"&nbsp;she added. After Geist asked&nbsp;McEntire, "What kept you going through those obstacles,"&nbsp;she replied, "Curiosity. Faith. Especially in the hard times, the bad times, the sad times. My faith. And just thinking, 'What more can we do?'"&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, McEntire's greatest hardship came several decades into her career when her mother, Jacqueline, died in 2020. Because McEntire's mom had been such a supportive force throughout her music career, she briefly considered leaving the music industry. "So when Mama passed, I thought, 'Where's my buddy? Where's my 'want-to'? She's not with me anymore,'" McEntire shared during an interview (via <a href=#>Country Now</a>). Fortunately, McEntire had a change of heart and is still working in the industry to this day. Come Fall 2023, McEntire will even join the "The Voice"&nbsp;judging panel as <a href=#>Blake Shelton's replacement</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamppZ4B6g46rnJubkWK6pLHNraCrnV2YvLa606uwZqWlqLakecKaqZ6domKxqrDNrWShmaaaeqi4wKamrqqfqsBursSgoKemmaO0cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
