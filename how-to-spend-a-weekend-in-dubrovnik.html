Once the capital of the mighty sea-faring Republic of Ragusa (1358-1808), it's now Croatia’s most upmarket destination. Historically, this diminutive republic was sophisticated, refined and cultured.</p><p>Today, the pedestrian-only Old Town – packed with aristocratic palazzi and elegant Baroque churches, contained within sturdy medieval fortifications – draws hundreds of thousands of visitors annually, including glamorous names such as Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Claudia Schiffer and Harrison Ford. Beyond the walls, attractions include wine bars, classy seafood restaurants and five-star hotels.</p><p>And then there's the glorious rock-and-pebble coast, with beaches, scuba diving and sea kayaking. Some of the best beaches lie on Lapad peninsular, two miles (three kilometres) west of town; or you might try tiny Lokrum islet, with its botanical garden (you can get taxi-boats from the old town harbour); or the pine-scented Elaphiti islands (ferry from Gruž port).</p><p>For further Dubrovnik inspiration, see our guides to the city's best <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hotels</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">restaurants</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bars and nightlife</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things to see and do</a>.</p><p><br>Any first-time visit to Dubrovnik should begin by walking a full circuit (just over a mile) of the magnificent 13th-century <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">City Walls</a>. It'll take well over an hour, and you can expect ever-changing perspectives over the terracotta rooftops of the Old Town and out to sea.&nbsp;To dodge the crowds, check how many cruise ships will be in Dubrovnik on any particular day on the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>Dubrovnik Port Authority</a>, and then pick what looks like the quietest date.</p><p>Afterwards, stroll along the limestone-paved Stradun (aka Placa), the main pedestrian thoroughfare through the Old Town, running from Pile Gate in the west to Ploče Gate in the east. Originally a sea channel, it was filled in during the 12th century, and is now lined with souvenir shops and pricey cafés.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Pick up fresh fruit at the morning market on Gundulićeva Poljana (Gundulić Square)</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: xeipe/xeipe</span></figure><p>On&nbsp;Gundulićeva Poljana&nbsp;(Gundulić Square), take a look at the open-air market (mornings only). In the past, all the stalls sold local seasonal fruit and vegetables, but nowadays you'll see mainly traditional gifts aimed at tourists – pretty handmade lavender bags, lavender oil, arancini (candied orange peel), bruštulane mjendorle (sugar-coated almonds) and dried figs. For lunch, grab a sandwich at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffet&nbsp;Škola</a>&nbsp;in a narrow alley off Stradun – they bake fresh bread and fill slabs of it with local cheese and pršut (similar to prosciutto), and also do a yummy homemade apple strudel.</p><p><br>To get some idea of how local aristocrats once lived, visit the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cultural History Museum</a>. Based in the 15th-century Rector's Palace, this is where the rector (city governor) would reside during his one-month term in office – on display are portraits of slightly cross-looking local nobles, as well as period furniture, costumes and clocks.&nbsp;It was also used as a location for Game of Thrones – if you're a fan, you'll recognise it as the atrium to the Spice King's palace in Qarth.</p><p>Nearby, the 17th-century Baroque Cathedral is also well worth a look in for its impressive Treasury, displaying ornately crafted golden reliquaries, including the skull of St Blaise (Dubrovnik's patron saint). And for liquid gold, call at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uje</a>&nbsp;on the Stradun, a shop specialising in Croatian olive oil – the owners have their own olive groves on the island of Brač, and you can ask to taste their oils before making a purchase.

Start with a sunset drink at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buža</a>, accessed through a tiny doorway in the city walls. Tables are arranged on a series of levels on the rocks overlooking the sea – informal but truly magical on a balmy evening.<br></p><p>Then, splash out at the romantic fish restaurant&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Proto</a>, to feast on lobster risotto and grilled sea bream – King Edward VIII and Wallace Simpson dined here in 1936. Round off the evening with a nightcap at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bar</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;order a mojito, deliciously refreshing on a hot summer night. Discover the best of Dubrovnik's nightlife with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">our guide</a>.</p><p><br>Start the day with a visit to&nbsp;this 13th-century&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fort Lovrijenac</a>. Lying outside the Old Town, it affords superb views of the City Walls, making it a favourite photo spot. Climb up 175 steps, to reach the upper level, complete with canons and a small chapel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Fort Lovrijenac offers superb views of the City Walls</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: SbytovaMN</span></figure><p>Then return to town to shop for gifts. Immediately outside Ploče Gate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life According to Kawa</a>&nbsp;is a welcoming concept store, specialising in quirky Croatian designer items, including their own limited edition of Dalmatia-inspired T-shirts and mugs, tastefully packaged rakija (a potent spirit) by Mashtel from Nin, and beautifully illustrated Croatian cookery books.</p><p>Nearby, inside Ploče Gate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dubrovačka Kuća</a>&nbsp;stocks paintings and ceramics by recognised Croatian artists, including raku-glazed ceramic fish by Ljiljana Barbarić, and ceramic candle-holders decorated with floral motifs by Andrea Bassi. Have lunch at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barba</a>, serving street food based on fresh local seafood – try the octopus burger, in a bread bun with salad and mayonnaise.</p><h4>Afternoon</h4><p>To discover more about Dubrovnik's historic naval power, visit the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maritime Museum</a>&nbsp;in St John's Fortress, overlooking the old harbour. In the 16th century, the city-republic had one of the world's largest fleets, with more than 180 ships and 4,000 sailors – exhibits here include model ships from that time, as well as navigational equipment, flags and maps.</p><p>Afterwards, grab an ice cream at nearby <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>Gianni's</a>, then spend the afternoon sunbathing and swimming in the deep blue Adriatic. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Banje beach</a>, immediately outside the town walls, and has a bar serving chilled drinks – take your own beach towel and lie on the pebbles, or pay extra for a sun-bed and parasol.&nbsp;Above the beach, there's a lounge-bar on a wooden deck, doing cocktails and snacks.<br></p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Spend the afternoon sunbathing and swimming at Banje beach</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Pilat666</span></figure><p><br>Start the evening in the Old Town with an amusing and informative Dalmatian wine tasting 'flight' (either three reds; or three whites) at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">D'Vino</a> wine bar in the Old Town – it's mellow and cosy, with several outdoor tables in the narrow side street.</p><p>For dinner, head to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Azur</a>,&nbsp;serving unusual but astoundingly delicious 'Cro-Asian' dishes, devised by the owner-chef, combing Dalmatian ingredients with Thai spices and fragrant herbs – try the superb swordfish fillet in black curry sauce.&nbsp;Close the day at Fratello's Prosecco Bar just outside the Old Town, sipping Croatian sparkling wine on their glorious sea-view terrace.

There's an abandoned 11th-century Benedictine Monastery. Climb to the highest point of the 19th-century Fort Royal for panoramic views. In summer, regular taxi-boats depart from the old harbour (journey time: 10 minutes; note that all visitors have to leave by sunset).<br></p><p>Take a ferry to the Elafiti islands of Lopud and Šipan to kayak, swim, snorkel and cliff-jump. Don't miss Šunj, one of Croatia's rare sandy beaches, when in Lopud.&nbsp;On the beach, several make-shift bars serve chilled drinks and snack until the sun goes down. &nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Lopud island is a lush escape with a rocky shore with spots for bathing</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Ante Prtenjaca / EyeEm</span></figure><p><br>The nearby coastal town of Cavtat (served by regular taxi-boat and local bus) was founded by the ancient Greeks. This huddle of old stone houses are built on a pine-scented peninsula sheltering a pebble beach to one side, and a natural harbour to the other. Its main attraction is the splendid Art Nouveaux Račić Mausoleum by sculptor Ivan Meštrović.<br></p><p><br>The&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>Dubrovnik Pass</a> affords entry to major cultural attractions, including the City Walls and Cultural Historical Museum, plus free transport on city buses.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Where to stay</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Luxury living</h2><p><br><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotel Excelsior</a> is built into a hillside above the coast, overlooking the deep blue sea and the pine-clad islet of Lokrum.

The down-side of tourism is that many locals have sold up and moved to the Lapad suburb, so the Old Town is semi-abandoned come winter.&nbsp;Some hotels and restaurants now open for Christmas and New Year, but almost everything is shut through the rest of January. And while a few places reopen for Carnival in February, the new season only really begins at Easter.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Know before you go</h2><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Essential information</h2><p><b><br>British Consulate:&nbsp;</b>The British Honorary Consulate Dubrovnik is closed until further notice.
