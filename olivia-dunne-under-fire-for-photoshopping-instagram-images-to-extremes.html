A video posted by an Instagram user named <strong>John Dorsey </strong>showed how the <strong>LSU </strong>gymnast edited every single Instagram photo to make herself look skinnier. The video revealed that Livvy had cinched her waist to the point where there was no room left for her internal organs.</p><p>While Olivia is a gorgeous girl with a killer body, even without Photoshop, her excessive photo manipulation is concerning. She deleted several photos after being called out but then edited photos published elsewhere (by LSU, magazines, etc.) to make herself look even tinier than she already is. This behavior has not gone unnoticed on <strong>TikTok</strong>, where there are hundreds of videos showcasing her excessive use of Photoshop.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Does Olivia Dunne use photoshop before posting images on Instagram?</h2><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Olivia Dunne draws criticism for alleged extreme Photoshop manipulation on her Instagram images</span><span class=ue-c-article__media-author><span>R.O.</span></span></p></figure><p>Olivia's excessive use of Photoshop is a clear indication that influencer culture is entirely out of control. It's understandable why she feels pressured to look perfect in all her pictures, given her status as one of the highest-paid female student-athletes in the nation. However, her actions only serve to reinforce the unrealistic beauty standards that society places on women.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Fans posted their displeasure</h2><p>Fans were quick to voice their displeasure in the comments section, with one user writing, "Stop photoshopping. You're ruining the future. And realistic standards. C'mon." Another user mockingly referred to Dunne as a "photoshop queen."</p><p>Dunne and LSU Gymnastics have since deleted the photos in question, but fans have continued to point out possible instances of photoshop in other pictures on Dunne's account. Some have noticed that her hair or the scenery around her appears to be warped, possibly due to the use of editing tools like FaceTune.</p><p>The controversy surrounding Dunne's photos highlights a larger issue of unrealistic beauty standards perpetuated by social media. As one commenter pointed out, "You're ruining the future. And realistic standards."</p><p>It's important for influencers and celebrities to be transparent with their followers about how they achieve their looks, whether through exercise, diet, or editing tools. By being honest about their methods, they can help promote a healthier and more realistic standard of beauty for their followers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqeamplfZ31zf45pcGhoZmSDdbKXmpprnGJrhaZ%2FxHGab5lol4F2ro9nn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
