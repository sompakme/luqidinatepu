If she was my friend, it would be horrible. But Melania and the White House had accused me of criminal activity and publicly shamed and fired me and made me their scapegoat. At that moment in time, that’s when I pressed record. She was no longer my friend and she was willing to let them take me down.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also claimed that during her time in the White House "Melania and I both didn’t use White House emails," Winston Wolkoff said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>UPDATE 8/27/20 9:45 A.M.:</strong> According to an exclusive report from the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a>, Melania Trump’s alleged comments pertain to Ivanka Trump’s behavior in the White House. “Melania complained that Ivanka was always competing with her for his attention as if she knew better and was more capable of being the First Lady,” a source reportedly connected to Wolkoff’s book told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Melania said Ivanka has not shown her the respect a First Lady deserves and is constantly trying to steal the spotlight by overstepping her boundaries and behaving like her father's most trusted confidant a la The Apprentice,” the source continued. “Behind Ivanka's back, Melania would often grumble to her inner circle that there's only one First Lady and that her husband was the person elected, not his entire family, referring to his kids.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There's no warmth between those two,” the source noted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stephanie Grisham, the First Lady's chief of staff, reportedly issued a response to reports of Melania's comments regarding her husband and his children. "I've never heard Mrs. Trump say anything disparaging about the family," she said. "I've heard a little bit about this book. I don't know much about it. It sounds like it's just another one of those books that unfortunately people are writing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If there were any recordings taken it's really unfortunate to take advantage of somebody's trust like that while being a friend, but I don't know much about the book. We're focused on the work we're doing," Grisham continued.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Previously:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tell-alls</a> keep coming …</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Melania Trump</a>’s former friend and senior advisor, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, is releasing a memoir chronicling her relationship with the first lady. According to reporter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Yashar Ali</a>, Wolkoff is expected to share negative remarks from Mrs. Trump regarding her husband and his adult children in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow">Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship With the First Lady</a>, which will be available Sept. 1. These comments were allegedly caught on tape.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the exact nature of said remarks is unknown, Ali reported that two sources confirmed that the book includes “harsh comments” from the first lady about her stepdaughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ivanka Trump</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wolkoff, the former director of special events at <i>Vogue, </i>became friends with<i> </i>Trump in 2003. She helped produce the 2017 inauguration and was appointed advisor to the first lady. According to the memoir’s description, “it all fell apart when [Wolkoff] was made the scapegoat for inauguration finance irregularities.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The book teases answers to the questions the public is most eager to learn: “How did Melania react to the <i>Access Hollywood </i>tape and her husband's affair with Stormy Daniels? Does she get along well with Ivanka? Why did she wear that jacket with "I really don't care, do u?" printed on the back? Is Melania happy being first lady? And what really happened with the inauguration's funding of $107 million?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8yeo5qmmZZ6tb7UpqdmoJGnwKl5wqikpp2eqcButdWapaSZXam%2FtrnPZpmop5s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
