She grew up with her mother and sisters in one of the most densely populated public project houses in North America.</span></p><p><span>Roxanne Shanté’s first taste of freestyling raps was inspired after seeing Nipsey Russell on TV.&nbsp;After practicing diligently, she grasped a firm grasp of rhyming and could rhyme on any subject instantly when she was only 8 years old.</span></p><p><span>Her musical talents were encouraged by her mother. When she joined a rap challenge at age 10, she performed exceptionally and won the $50 prize.&nbsp;After that, there was no stopping her as she challenged all the rappers around her hood to a rap match.&nbsp;This earned Roxanne the title “Queen of Queens” and she eventually became a local celebrity.</span></p><p><span>Although Roxanne Shanté gave up her education during middle school to focus on hip-hop, it was later revealed that she attended Marymount Manhattan College for 3 months.&nbsp;She was previously signed to an independent record label called Cold Chillin Records, which had worked with Warner Bros to distribute her work.&nbsp;This was between 1987 and 1992.</span></p><span>Roxanne Shanté first came to prominence at the age of 14. Her record was played on the radio by DJ Mr. Magic.&nbsp;She was formerly a believer in Marlon Williams Marley;&nbsp;her neighbor in the hood to do a short rap verse in response to an earlier song by UTFO against Marlon Marley’s group for not showing up to a concert they had previously been invited to.&nbsp;Payment for Roxanne Shante’s time and rap verse was an agreed pair of jeans from Marlon Marley.</span><p><span>The clap-back rap was produced by Marlon Marley, who eventually gave it DJ Mr. Magic, who first played it on the radio, featured the squeaky little voice of Roxanne, who formed the UTFO group, this song became their first hit single with titled&nbsp;</span><span>Roxanne’s Revenge</span><span>&nbsp;and it was well received.&nbsp;The song sold over 250,000 copies in New York alone and peaked at 78 on Billboard Hot 100 and 22 on Hot Black Singles, which became known as RnB Hip Hop Songs in 1985, and was the beginning of various works they would later do together as they formed quickly formed a group, Juice Crew, with Roxanne Shante as the only teenage female member.</span></p><p><span>The crew members are Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, MC Shan, Marlon Marley and Roxanne.&nbsp;They then released a handful of hits&nbsp;</span><span>Roxanne’s Revenge</span><span>&nbsp;and they toured the nation together from 1983 to 1991 before splitting up, although they’d reunited to make good music in the past.</span></p><p><span>Her raps were said to be full of vulgar lyrics. Considered one of the best of her time, she pioneered “rap battles” and “dissing” in the hip-hop music industry.&nbsp;Roxanne Shanté, throughout her career, had dispersed industry figures outside of the UTFO group, and these are them;&nbsp;KRS-Another rival group, Queen Latifah, Yoyo, Monie Love, MC Lyte, LLCool J, among others.&nbsp;She was a fearless teenager whose propensity was to dispute anyone from any neighborhood whenever they earned their respect from others in the industry.</span></p><p><span>From the beginning of this legend’s career between the ages of 14 and 25, she had a total of 2 studio albums&nbsp;</span><span>Bad Sisters</span><span>&nbsp;(1989) and&nbsp;</span><span>The Bitch Is Back</span><span>&nbsp;(1992) with over 18 critically acclaimed hot singles such as;&nbsp;</span><span>Roxanne’s Revenge</span><span>&nbsp;(1984)&nbsp;</span><span>, Carry On</span><span>&nbsp;(1988),&nbsp;</span><span>Have a Nice Day</span><span>&nbsp;(1987)&nbsp;</span><span>, What’s Up</span><span>&nbsp;(2000) and the list goes on.</span></p><p><span>She also recorded 3 soundtracks&nbsp;</span><span>Colors</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>Lean on Me and the City of Girls</span><span>&nbsp;all released in 1988, 1989 and 1996 but she sadly didn’t continue with the changing times in hip hop as the new trend may have been new and different than that, who she grew up with.&nbsp;This change and her personal issues took her off the radar, although she still found time to attend shows and even perform at social events like weddings etc.</span></p><p><span>Her biopic&nbsp;</span><span>Roxanne Roxanne</span><span>&nbsp;was written in 2017 as a screenplay for a film directed by a newly minted talent, Chante Adams as Shante.&nbsp;The film debuted at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and received positive reviews.</span></p><p><span>The film was written and directed by Michael Larnell, while Forest Whitaker and Pharrell Williams produced the film.&nbsp;The Neon studio later acquired the film rights and subsequently released the film in various other locations that same year.&nbsp;It will be streaming on Netflix from March 2018 and has already achieved considerable success.</span></p><p><span>In a recent interview, Roxanne Shanté revealed she was a double breast cancer survivor.&nbsp;She posted the pictures of her scars online on her Instagram page to encourage other survivors to like their bodies and stay positive.</span></p><h2><strong><span>your fortune</span></strong></h2><p><span>The First Lady of Rap is currently worth an estimated half a million dollars ($500,000).&nbsp;She could have been worth a lot more if she hadn’t been cheated out of her royalties and contract income generated by her handlers on her tours and shows during her productive years in the music industry.&nbsp;Thankfully, Roxanne Shanté’s reappearance in the movie currently airing on Netflix will see her net worth increase in the near future.</span></p><h2><strong><span>husband or baby dad son</span></strong></h2><p><span>Roxanne Shanté is happily married but not to her dad, James Cross, with whom she dated from the age of 14 and was born when she was 15.&nbsp;She reported that she suffered physical abuse which left her in a hospital with broken ribs on one such occasion.&nbsp;From then on she had to end the relationship and left her son Kareem who was with him for two years.&nbsp;Although she later got him back through her attorney with $10,000 – the amount James Cross demanded before he fired her son.</span></p><p><span>Cross was her manager at the time and is said to have been 18 years older than Roxanne Shante.&nbsp;She later married a retired boxer whose name is currently unknown.&nbsp;She has 3 sons and a daughter;&nbsp;Kareem, Randy, Chris and Tajze who are fine.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where is she now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Netflix streaming of the rapper’s life has opened the door for her fans and even the younger generation to get personal with her.&nbsp;She currently resides in New Jersey with her husband, where she runs an educational non-governmental organization called&nbsp;</span><span>Matter of Will.&nbsp;</span><span>However, Roxanne does occasionally appear in shows, ceremonies and events and has made guest appearances on television shows a few times.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiqn62ur7rEZqqhmZ6psm6uyKhkrKeeYrW2v8GapZ1ln6d6o63BsmSdmZSZxm66xK1ksKeiqbVuw8eeqZ5lmah6tLTEZqWor18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
