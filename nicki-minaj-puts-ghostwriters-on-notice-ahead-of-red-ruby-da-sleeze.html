The singer announced the single, “<a href=# rel>Red Ruby Da Sleeze</a>” during her appearance in Trinidad during Carnival. It marks the first solo single from the Queens rapper following her first chart-topping hit, “<a href=# rel>Super Freaky Girl.</a>” More importantly, it appears to be the official launch of the rollout for her follow-up to Queen. It’s been nearly five years since her last album and fans have had an insatiable appetite for more music from Nicki.</p><p>Following the release of the new single, she’ll return to the airwaves for Queen Radio. It seems as though her upcoming broadcast could provide more details on not just the song, but her upcoming album. Hopefully, she’ll reveal a title or at least a timeframe of when we could expect the project to land on DSPs. At the same time, we could certainly expect Nicki to air out some of her grievances. Only time will tell but fans are counting down the clock until midnight until Nicki unloads her upcoming single.</p><span><h2 id=h-nicki-minaj-warns-ghostwriters>Nicki Minaj Warns Ghostwriters</h2></span><p>With the new single expected to drop in less than 12 hours, Nicki Minaj has fans across the world anticipating her return. Nicki’s status as the Queen of Hip-Hop has undoubtedly been tested over the years as several individuals alleged that she uses a ghostwriter. Since Nicki’s emerged, <a href=# rel>she’s taken pride in the fact that she pens her own bars</a>, and as we’ve seen in the past, the use of a ghostwriter can take a toll on an artist’s overall reputation.</p><p>As she hyped the release of her new single, she unveiled a Chun-Li-inspired photoshoot before putting ghostwriters on notice. “Tmrw night,” Nicki captioned the picture. “Ghostwriters all around the world are scrambling Just watch. Nicki still on hiatus. This b!@ch right her tho? She outside.” Nicki’s clearly readying to clear the room with her upcoming single but will it help her attain another #1 on the Billboard Hot 100? Only time will tell.
