The Raptors ended up winning the game, so you know both father and son were treated to a show. In some images below, posted by the NBA, the two seemed to be having a blast.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Interestingly enough, Adonis was wearing a pair of LaMelo Ball signature sneakers. Sure, Melo might play for the other team, although Drake and Adonis decided to show love anyway. As for Drizzy, he wore some bizarre platforms with a fuzzy top.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Toronto Raptors have struggled at times this season, however, they have a couple of wins over the last few games. They are looking to make the playoffs, and their ascent is beginning now. Only time will tell whether or not they have the juice to actually get into the play-in.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of Drake and Adonis' footwear, in the comments down below.
