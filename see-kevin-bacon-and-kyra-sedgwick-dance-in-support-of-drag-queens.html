The couple strutted a coordinated step to Swift’s “Karma” while sporting t-shirts that read “Drag is an art and drag is a right.” The move is aimed at raising money and awareness for groups targeted by a series of “drag bans” circulating several state legislatures.</p><p>“Drag bans are bad karma,” Kevin Bacon wrote along with his video with Kyra Sedgwick. “Right now, drag performers and the LGBTQIA+ community need our help. Tap the link in my bio to shop the <a href=#>@SixDegreesOfKB</a> campaign supporting the <a href=#>@aclu_nationwide</a> Drag Defense Fund in the nationwide effort to protect creative expression or make a gift. <a href=#>#DragIsARight</a>“</p><p>The “drag bans” Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are referring to were outlined in <a href=#>Time Magazine</a>. Several conservative states have introduced legislation that would prohibit public drag performances where minors could be in attendance. In the case of Florida, that even includes screenings of the 1975 film <a href=#>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>.</p><p>Republican lawmakers have cited child safety and family values as primary the driving forces behind these bills. Critics have called the bills thinly veiled acts of oppression against the LGBTQIA+ community, citing increased rates of depression and suicide among community members who are boxed out of networks of support.</p><p>Comments on the Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick dance ranged from fire emoji support to staunch alliance with the proposed laws. The husband and wife duo have resisted backlash whipped at them in the comments section and continued to post about the campaign.</p><p>The shirts Kevin Back and Kyra Sedgwick are sporting in the video are for sale through Bacon’s Sixdegrees nonprofit organization. Inspired by the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon meme, the organization connects people to charitable causes to build a network of support for a variety of humanitarian causes. The design on the shirt is also available on notebooks, mugs, and tote bags.</p><p>Both Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick have had storied acting careers. The pair met while filming Lemon Sky, and thanks to some clever pursuit by Bacon, they eventually went on a date. They married in 1988, have two children, and have stuck together ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/kevin-bacon-sebastian-shaw-900x506.jpg><p>Kevin Back is the star of classics like Footloose, Tremors, and Mystic River. He has also had his time in the superhero sun as the <a href=#>X-Men</a>: First Class villain Sebastian Shaw, and as himself in Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. Kyra Sedgwick is best known for her role on TNT’s The Closer, and was a recurring character on Brooklyn Nine-Nine.</p><p>Kevin Bacon will appear alongside Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke in Leave the World Behind, a drama film set to release this December. He will also appear in the horror comedy remake The Toxic Avenger and in the conclusion of Ti West’s X horror trilogy, <a href=#>MaXXXine</a>. Kyra Sedgwick will appear next in the local politics drama Thirsty.</p><p>Celebrities and politics are a dangerous mix, but in the case of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick, the pair are striving to make an impact. How their actions and statements will be met by fans going forward is out of their control, but if Bacon’s posts on Instagram convey anything, it is that the couple is not worried about the comment section.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnm5rDqrqMm5icp55iuLq%2BwGaqnpyXrLakt4ydmKeblWO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
