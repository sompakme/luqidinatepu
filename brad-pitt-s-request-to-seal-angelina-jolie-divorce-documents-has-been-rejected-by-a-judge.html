"I am extremely concerned that if court records regarding custody are not sealed, information contained therein will cause irreparable damage to our children's privacy rights," the 52-year-old wrote in a sworn declaration.</p><p id=eQOdwAg2VNHb data-wc=40>The American stars, who <strong class=redactor-inline-converted><a class=hm-link href=#>split in September</a></strong> after more than 10 years together, did not attend the hearing.

The pair - who met on the set of , and have been together since 2004 - married in an intimate ceremony two years ago in their home in France. "I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids," Brad released in a statement. "I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time." The couple are parents to six children; Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3acace597711-brad-z.jpg><p class=text-center id=eMp-GL38g9Lf data-wc=12><strong class=redactor-inline-converted>The Hollywood couple&nbsp;split in September after more than 10 years together</strong></p><p id=eDes5mBIgkyI data-wc=96>The actress has requested <a class=hm-link href=#>sole physical custody</a> with visitation rights for Brad, who in turn filed for joint custody in his divorce papers. Last month, Angelina's spokesperson said the custody agreement was reached in consultation with childcare specialists. It read: "We can confirm that childcare professionals have encouraged a legal agreement accepted and signed by both sides over a week ago. In accordance with this agreement, the six children will stay in their mother's custody, and the children will continue therapeutic visits with their father. This has been determined by childcare professionals to be in the children's best interest.</p><p id=eVbkKLStZgjZ data-wc=63>"We are not in a position to discuss the details. We hope now that it is clear that the events which led to the dissolution filing involved minor children and their wellbeing, there will be understanding of the sensitivity of the family situation. We believe that all sides are committed to healing the family and ask for your consideration during this difficult time."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
