The Philadelphia artist and the Toronto-born rapper have worked together on songs like "<a href=# rel>Wanted You,</a>" as well as "Leaders." But beyond their working relationship, they've proven to be great friends who hold each other's creative output in high regard. For example, Uzi previously defended Nav against trolling, labeling the Canadian rapper/producer as a "genius" who gives his fanbase exactly what they expect every single time he drops music.</p><p>Nav always reciprocates the love. He previously went to bat for Uzi in the middle of his disagreements with Generation Now. After the Philly rapper stated that he was quitting music, Nav said <a href=# rel>he was going to do the same in solidarity.</a> Shortly after the release of Bad Habits, Nav dropped "Free Lil Uzi Vert" t-shirts. "We met very early in our career. And we don't even really talk to each other like musicians. We talk to each other like friends. We hang out," Nav told Complex of their relationship. "Our relationship is very unique. It's different from everybody else that I have relationships with."</p><span><h2 id=h-nav-catches-lil-uzi-vert-slippin>Nav Catches Lil Uzi Vert Slippin’</h2></span><p>Their friendly relationship undoubtedly allows both Nav and Lil Uzi Vert to crack jokes at each other’s expense. Last night, Nav hit the ‘Gram with CCTV footage of Uzi's massive fail. Uzi and Nav walked out of a studio when Uzi tried to pull a daredevil stunt and leap into the pool. Unfortunately, he missed the mark completely and fell into the swimming pool as Nav cracked up in the corner. “Caught Uzi slippin leaving my studio last night,” he wrote.</p><p>It’s unclear what they were working on in the studio exactly but perhaps, it’s something for their respective projects. In October, Nav confirmed that he’s working on the sequel to his 2017 self-titled project. Though he’s expected to hit the road in the coming weeks, it seems as though he’s plotting to release the project soon. Meanwhile, Lil Uzi Vert’s <a href=# rel>The Pink Tape</a> is expected to drop this month following the viral success of the single, “Just Wanna Rock,” which recently cracked the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaH10fo9mo6KkXarHqnnVnqmtZaSWuKa%2FjJpkn5mcoXqquoynmK%2BrXaW8sLiMsJitm5g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
