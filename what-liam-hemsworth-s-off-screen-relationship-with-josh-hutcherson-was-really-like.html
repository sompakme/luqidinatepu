When the pair signed on for the "Hunger Games" films, they had no idea that they were going to get such a great friendship out of it.</p><p>The pair has gotten so close that they can joke about smooching one another! Seems random, but Hemsworth teased to <a href=#>E! News</a> that he and Hutcherson kissed in "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire." The Australian native shared, "Josh and I kiss in this film. It's a really epic scene. I'm excited for fans to see it." Of course, "The Last Song" actor was kidding as he couldn't give any details on the upcoming film, but that didn't stop him from continuing the joke. He said, "If you're talking about similarities and differences between the book and the movies, that's one of them â€” Josh and I kiss."</p><p>Their co-star, Jennifer Lawrence, even shared some interesting details about the activity the three would participate in following movie premieres, per <a href=#>The New York Times</a>. Lawrence revealed, "The boys and I would always go back to our hotel and just drink whiskey and get stoned." The intensity of how popular the films were made things overwhelming, which is why they would partake in drinking and smoking. But through it all, the trio always had each other to lean on, especially "the boys," as Lawrence called them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampoaoJ1hY6loJqlXZ2yrr%2FWqKmtoF2ZtqeyxKucp6xdp7KtrdOipqermJ69brbOrJ9moKWpsKmx0aymp2Wfm7Nuv8KrnJ6mXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
