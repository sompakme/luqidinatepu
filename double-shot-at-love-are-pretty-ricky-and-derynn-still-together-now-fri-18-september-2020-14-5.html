They are still publicly flirting with each other, but it hasn’t been confirmed whether they are still together. Even so, it looks like they are on very good terms. Derynn recently posted an Instagram picture with some glasses on, with Ricky commenting: “I’d willing stay after class for extra credit, maybe detention, either or.” Derynn responded to him: “You’re already expelled.”</p><p>However on Twitter Derynn has told viewers to wait until next week’s episode of Double Shot At Love to find out if they are still together. And straight after last night’s episode, she announced something which pretty much gives the status of their relationship away.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I got the real double shot at love <a href=#>#doubleshotatlove</a></p><p>— Derynn Paige (@Derynn_Paige) <a href=#>September 18, 2020</a></p></figure>View Tweet<p>Although this isn’t confirmed to be with Pretty Ricky himself, she retweeted a fan’s Tweet which states: “<span class=r-18u37iz><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1n1174f r-1loqt21 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" role=link href=# data-focusable=true>@RickyRogers</a>_</span>being so sweet to <span class=r-18u37iz><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1n1174f r-1loqt21 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" role=link href=# data-focusable=true>@Derynn_Paige</a> </span>is the cutest.

They got together before Derynn later found out about his job. After they met up for a second time, they went home together. This led to some complications, and Derynn told Vinny that she didn’t usually invite people back. However, they ended up later going on a date together and hitting it off straight away.</p><p>In last night’s episode, Derynn and Ricky made their relationship official. They kissed and Ricky plucked up the courage to ask Derynn to be his girlfriend.
