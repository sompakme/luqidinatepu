Moreover, the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">GOD DID</a>" singer is gearing up for the release of his debut studio album sometime in August, and had a big day on Friday (July 21) to get the ball rolling. Not only did he pull up to Rolling Loud Miami to perform for his fans, but he also released the new single "When It Comes To You" with an accompanying music video. As many fans probably expect, this song is a showcase of the Philadelphia artist's vocal talents and penchant for gorgeous harmonies. While he hasn't gotten married yet, he leans heavily into themes of commitment and loyalty through not just the lyrics, but the marriage-themed visuals as well.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, this loving and tender narrative benefitted from the production on "When It Comes To You." Slow and warm guitars lead the track's melody, with ghostly background vocals establishing the atmosphere. Fridayy also harmonizes with a choir on multiple instances on this cut, highlighting the vocal melodies to make a catchy and climactic chorus. In addition, the percussive elements on this single fall well within standards of slow-burning and crisp R&B production. It ultimately makes for a relaxed but peaceful jam that's as lustful as it is caring, and as sultry as it is emotive.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-fridayy-s-when-it-comes-to-you-watch-the-music-video>Fridayy's "When It Comes To You": Watch The Music Video</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, this is surely the start of what could be a massive moment for the musician with his new album coming soon.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmboR2gJRmnauhlJbGunnWoZynZZmpeqS7zJ6qZqyfYsawwYysq6udkaJ6rsHSoppmrpmZsrA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
