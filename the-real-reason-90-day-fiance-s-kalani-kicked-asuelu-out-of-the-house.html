Things got nasty when Kalani and Asuelu visited Asuelu's mother, Lesina, in Washington. While there, Lesina asked for a $1,000 loan from the couple. Kalani told her the couldn't spare that much, and the&nbsp;<a href=#>argument escalated</a>&nbsp;from there. At one point,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kalani even got into a physical altercation</a>&nbsp;with Asuelu's sister, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a>. Making matters worse? Asuelu didn't step in to defend his wife, making Kalani question whether the marriage is worth saving.</p><p>Given all of the conflict, some fans were hardly surprised when it got revealed that Asuelu and Kalani were&nbsp;<a href=#>no longer living together</a>. At the hight of the COVID-19 virus, Kalani became even more annoyed with Asuelu for not taking social distancing and other health precautions seriously.

"Today, we are together, and we're living together, but we aren't anywhere near where we used to be when we were first together," she explained, according to&nbsp;Showbiz&nbsp;Cheat Sheet. "We're just in a really rocky place right now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma25gaYN1e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl1ufW6wwLJkn6GRo7Cmv4ykmKWZnp56rLXCpJydZZGowqa41GamrqxdpLNuwMeeZKGnpaiycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
