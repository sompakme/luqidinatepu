And as his family, friends, colleagues—<a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a> among them—and fans mourn his passing, <a href=#>Bungie</a> released a statement regarding Reddick’s contributions to the game, as well as the future of his character in Destiny 2.</p><p><a href=#>The studio behind</a> Destiny 2 stated that they’ll honor Lance Reddick’s presence through his performances yet to come in Destiny 2, indicating that Commander Zavala won’t be recast. Instead, the late actor will continue to portray the role posthumously until all the storylines to which he contributed have been concluded. However, what happens afterward, only Bungie knows. Given Reddick’s extensive portrayal of the character, it’s highly unlikely that Bungie will ever find a suitable replacement without seriously altering the character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/destiny-2-zavala-lance-reddick-bungie-titan-commander-900x506.jpg><p>This could mean that Commander Zavala will be narratively written out of Destiny 2 and most likely killed. He’s already a Guardian, so it’s unlikely for him to receive the same treatment as another <a href=#>fan-favorite character</a>, but anything’s possible in gaming, and Zavala’s return isn’t excluded. Suppose he goes anywhere in the first place. For now, we can all still enjoy Lance’s portrayal of Zavala, at least for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Lance Reddick, who died at the age of 60, appeared in several other gaming releases, including Horizon Zero Dawn, and, as Bungie stated, Reddick was an avid gamer himself. In fact, he was an active voice in the Destiny community, engaging with the fans and valuing the community’s connection to Zavala and himself. According to his Bungie account, he even played Destiny 2 the night before he passed.</p><p>The actor has several other posthumous roles and acting work waiting to be released, including John Wick: Chapter 4, which launched recently. He also reprised his role in a John Wick spin-off titled <a href=#>Ballerina</a>, which follows the events of John Wick 3, and focuses on Ana de Armas’ character, Rooney. The film entered post-production in February, and unfortunately, it still lacks a release date. It’s worth noting that this will be Reddick’s final appearance as Charon and one of his last screen appearances.</p><p>And that isn’t the end. Besides his continued portrayal of Commander Zavala in Destiny 2, Lance Reddis will also portray Zeus in <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Disney data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Disney</a>‘s television interpretation of Percy Jackson and the Olympians and three other films scheduled to release in the coming months. This includes the 2023 remake of 1992’s White Men Can’t Jump, scheduled for a May 19 release; the Shirley Chisolm biopic Shirley, whose release date is soon to be announced; and The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial, which is an in-production adaptation of a 1953 drama play.</p><p>Lance Reddick’s passing is a great loss to both the entertainment industry and the fans of his work. His portrayal of Commander Zavala has been an integral part of the Destiny 2 universe, and his commanding presence and distinctive voice have helped bring the character to life. His talent and dedication to his craft will be remembered by many, and his legacy will continue to live on through his work. Our condolences to his family and close friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8aapJ6rX6Gur6%2FEZqmenJSesKx5w56qraGernpzecWipZqkXp3Brrg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
