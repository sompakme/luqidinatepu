Speaking to the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Financial Times</a>, she spoke of her children's academic struggles, too, adding: "dyslexia doesn't run in our family, it gallops." She also said that all of her children are more passionate about artistic or sporting pursuits, since 20-year-old Brooklyn is an aspiring photographer, Romeo, 16, is training to be a tennis player, Cruz, 14, loves to sing and little Harper, who is seven years old, "is a real little tomboy".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c89c7b0d2d2-beckhams-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eBaPWx9_EbaR data-wc=14><strong>The family (and Brooklyn's girlfriend, Hana Cross)&nbsp;supported Victoria at her recent LFW show</strong></p><p id=eUedM3pQMWC0 data-wc=97>The fashion designer also spoke of her three sons' natural footballing talent, and the moment they decided they didn't want to follow in dad <a class=hm-link href=#>David Beckham</a>'s footsteps. "All three boys used to have contracts with Arsenal," she said. "Brooklyn was the first to say he didn't want to play any more. And then Romeo decided he didn't want to do it either. I remember Romeo sitting in the bath getting really upset saying, 'I don't want to let Daddy down'. So I told him daddy just wants you to be happy. And now he's playing tennis.
