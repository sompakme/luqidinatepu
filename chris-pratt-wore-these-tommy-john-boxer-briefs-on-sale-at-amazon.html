The minute you can afford stuff, they start sending it to you for free, like socks and underwear. I haven’t bought socks and underwear in ages. I’m wearing underwear that got sent to my house, I don’t even know who this person is. Some guy named Tommy John sent me his underwear and I’m wearing it. Send me your dirty underwear and I’ll wear ’em. They seem clean, they were in a package and stuff. They’re comfy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tommy-John-Second-Skin-Trunks-Navy-EMBED-2023.png><p><span class="c-span a-font-accent-l lrv-u-font-weight-bold">Tommy John Second Skin Trunk with Contour Pouch </span><span class="c-span a-font-accent-l lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-a-icon-before a-icon-comma">$102.00</span><span class="c-span a-font-accent-l lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-a-icon-before a-icon-comma">on Amazon.com</span></p><a class="c-button larva lrv-u-display-block lrv-a-unstyle-button lrv-u-cursor-pointer lrv-u-padding-tb-075 lrv-u-padding-lr-3 lrv-u-background-color-brand-primary lrv-u-width-100p@mobile-max lrv-u-text-align-center lrv-u-margin-tb-150 lrv-u-margin-tb-075@desktop-xl" href=# rel=nofollow><span class="c-button__inner lrv-u-color-white lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-size-16">Buy now</span></a><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While we’ll never know whether the mention was an artfully disguised product placement moment, we do know that more than <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>95 percent of reviewers</a> agree with Pratt in the comfort department.
