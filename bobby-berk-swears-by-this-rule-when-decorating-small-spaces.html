Whatever your stance on this, Bobby Berk believes that even the most compact spaces can be turned into something beautiful – and we're certainly inclined to agree.&nbsp;</p><p>The design expert & Emmy-nominated TV host sat down to talk design with H&G – following his latest endeavor with TriPointe Homes. The units, located in Arroyo's Edge, Las Vegas, serve as a trove of inspiration for <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/how-to-make-a-small-room-look-bigger>making small rooms look bigger</a> and fresh <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/room-color-ideas>room color ideas</a> – playing with a Scandicool, Mid-century aesthetic that appeals to their target audience (those with specific lifestyles who want a designer-approved base that won't fall out of style).&nbsp;</p><p>The homes offered Bobby a blank canvas to experiment with color – something that gave him time to reminisce on another project that taught him how to master <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/how-to-decorate-small-spaces-219828>decorating small spaces</a>: his parent's home.&nbsp;</p><p>'A few years ago, I redesigned my parent's house, and it was a particular challenge because it was a compact size,' Bobby says. 'It had low ceilings and a lack of natural light. To overcome it, I started by painting all the interiors white, which gives it a seamless flow and brightened everything up.'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4PRAXEMjFXAFghHra9SkZW-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg><span class=person__name>Bobby Berk</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Interior designer and Queer Eye star<p>Whatever your <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/small-room-ideas>small room ideas</a>, Bobby Berk's color rule remains the same: go white.&nbsp;</p><p>'Before [the renovation], my mum had the kitchen painted terracotta, the living room was a khaki color, and the front porch was yellow. What a lot of people don’t understand is – when they have smaller spaces – and you paint them in different colors – you’re actually making them feel even smaller,' Bobby says.&nbsp;</p><p>You would be forgiven for believing that any bright-colored paint can elevate a compact room – but as Bobby explains, it can have quite the opposite effect.&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Design expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.</p><p>'Many people think a bright color will make it feel bright and airy, but it doesn’t. Your eye automatically categorizes each space which is a different color, as a different space, Bobby says. 'When you’re already working with small spaces, and you’re making them even smaller by breaking them down by color – it makes them feel even more compact.'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XPTJxXp3Wrymxv34Dt7EAW-1920-80.jpg><p>Knowing <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/what-colors-make-a-small-room-look-bigger>what colors make a small room look big</a> is the most impactful thing you can do in a compact home – and Bobby recommends going white – but that doesn't mean you need to veto all vibrancy completely.&nbsp;</p><p>'When working with a smaller space, try to make all the walls the same color. Try to work with white. It makes things look bigger and brighter. Then, you bring in your personality through the colors in the rugs, pillows, and a little bit of wallpaper,' the designer says.&nbsp;</p><p>'Make everything cohesive with the wall color, and when it comes to furniture, I use furniture that’s on a smaller scale. Scale is super important in design.'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YgkWAtRtHr7kdPcKCzMhvW-1920-80.jpg><p>Yes, when learning how to&nbsp;make a small room look bigger – color is key. However, as Bobby mentioned, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/scale-in-interior-design>scale</a> is also vital to sucsess.&nbsp;</p><p>'A lot of people, when they go to buy a sofa, chose one that is only comfortable. Yes, you do want one that is comfortable, but you also want one that works with the scale of the room,' he says.'</p><p>'If you have a room with lower ceilings, you don’t want to buy a sofa that has a really tall back. You want to choose something that will elongate the walls and is more to scale with the room. Armless chairs and mirrors are a great way to make compact spaces feel better.'&nbsp;</p><p>Bobby, our small rooms thank you.&nbsp;</p><p>You can discover more about the designer's work with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.tripointehomes.com/nv/las-vegas/arroyos-edge/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Tri Pointe Homes</a> via their website now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvMnqqappScrrOwxKeqZ5ufonyvsdasZp2dk6S%2Fbr7UpZysZZKkr6PFjJucq6NdqMSmrdGsZKaZm5p6tLnApaNmq6CWsKa%2FjKWmqKNdl7aos8Sr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
