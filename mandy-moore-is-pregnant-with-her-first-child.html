I'm having this unfettered time to spend with my husband at home that I'll never get again."</p><p>The star also admitted she has a tendency to have "a real avoidance for being present sometimes," but says that lockdown has allowed her to "relish" that part of herself, because she doesn't need to follow a schedule.</p><p>She added: "But now I really relish it. I love waking up and having my routine, but being open to whatever the day is going to bring.
