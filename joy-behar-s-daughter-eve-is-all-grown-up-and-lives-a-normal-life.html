But she almost did. Eve began her professional life in television production, but that's not where her heart was. While she worked, Eve&nbsp;began exploring her passion for the arts. In&nbsp;1991, she&nbsp;took a ceramics class in her native New York. Eventually, Eve decided to turn her passion into a career. In the early '90s, Eve&nbsp;studied crafts and design at Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning in Ontario, Canada.</p><p>In 1995, she took her work to the next level, spending a year in Florence, Italy, studying&nbsp;ceramics, painting, and art history at the Studio Arts Centers International. Clay provided the best medium for Eve to both express her vision and connect with the audience. "Utilitarian ceramic art provides a direct link of connectivity between the maker and the user," she wrote on her <a href=#>website</a>.&nbsp;Now Eve runs her own ceramics studio&nbsp;from her home in&nbsp;Sag Harbor, New York.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>New York Post</a>, Eve has owned the home since May 2021, when her mother transferred the five-bed, four-bath estate to her. Before taking her talents to the beachside, Eve lived in&nbsp;an Upper West Side apartment where she counted Joy among her neighbors. Despite being a&nbsp;Manhattanite, Eve is happier in nature. "[I] was lucky to live next to Forest Park and loved exploring what seemed like deep woods," she <a href=#>wrote</a>, describing her childhood.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtnbH52go6jprJlkpq1or6MnZiun5ipsrN5xK%2BcZpmcoXqovs6wpWatoGK7sL7MmqNmpJmbsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
