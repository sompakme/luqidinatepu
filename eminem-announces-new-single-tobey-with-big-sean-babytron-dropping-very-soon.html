Moreover, he unveiled a short but chainsaw-bloodied visual clip teasing the release of the new single "Tobey," which will feature <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Big Sean</a> and BabyTron. "Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me? It was a goat," you can hear 'Tron rap towards the end of the eerie snippet.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tobey Maguire, of course, played the beloved titular role in 2002's Spider-Man, but Eminem, Big Sean, and BabyTron represent Detroit GOATs. A lot of fans are very excited about this upcoming track, as folks might not have expected Marshall Mathers to link up with 'Tron (he has other collabs with the Sean Don). The fact that it's all three of them together just makes it all the merrier, and a Detroit-style instrumental after a beat switch would go absolutely hard. But we'll be happy with whatever comes of this, and we'll probably be surprised. After all, the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Houdini</a>" lyricist has more than a few tricks up his sleeve.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-eminem-announces-tobey-single-with-big-sean-amp-babytron>Eminem Announces "Tobey" Single With Big Sean & BabyTron</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, Eminem recently achieved a tall but not at all shocking honor: landing on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Wayne</a>'s <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">top five MCs of all time list</a>. No one really batted an eye at his placement on here, instead focusing on the obvious but currently charged choice from Weezy to put his <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Money</a> partner <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> on there and not his 2024 beef rival Kendrick Lamar. What most fans really hope from The Death Of Slim Shady is that Em proves consistently and in at least corny of a way as possible why he deserves to be on there. But it seems like this project might lean into a tongue-in-cheek approach to his career, which is also very welcome.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, are you excited for this upcoming collaboration between Eminem, Big Sean, and BabyTron? Beyond "Tobey," what are your predictions for The Death Of Slim Shady and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">what kind of bars</a> we'll get from him?

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
