They are professional fighters, but they are not expert hand-to-hand combat specialists, as the name implies.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>When it comes to combat, which military branch has the greatest mortality rate?</h3><p>In comparison to all other services, the Marine Corps had the highest death rates per 100,000 for all causes (122.5), accidental injury (77.1), suicide (14.0), and murder (74.4) of any branch of service.
