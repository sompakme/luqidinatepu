He was only 36-years-old, and there was so much left for him to do. His name has received a ton of tributes today, and that’s not going to stop any time soon.</p><p><a href=#>Plenty of members of the pro wrestling community</a> have spoken out to pay tribute to Seth Rollins. <a href=#>Paul Wight also gave tear-filled</a> tribute during an interview in London while he prepares for AEW All In.</p><p>Seth Rollins dropped a video message to fans where he shared his thoughts on Bray Wyatt. He said that Wyatt was complex, but he loved him. He also loved working with him, because Wyatt was always so full of joy. He also mentioned a conversation he had with Bray after Brodie Lee’s untimely passing.</p><p>“Truth is, I still don’t really know what to say. Windham was a unique cat. Simple, yet deeply complex individual. And I loved him. I loved him, I loved working with him, but mostly I just loved being around him. He was always joyful. Just these eyes that drew you in and a smile and a laugh and a presence that just made you happy and we’re all going to miss that.”</p><p>“I’ve been thinking mostly about his family, and I wanted to go. I don’t know if wanted was the right word. I thought about going to Smackdown tonight, but that would entail leaving my family a day early. I just keep going back to the conversation I had with Wyndham on the phone when Brodie [Lee] passed a few years ago. And, you know, I just had called him to check on him to see how he was doing. And we talked, and he was okay, and I was okay and neither of us were really okay. We ended the conversation with I love yous and goodbyes. And I remember this very specifically. He said, you just go hug on that baby girl, talking about my daughter. And so I just feel like that’s what I should be doing. So Windham, I love you, man. I will miss you. We will all miss you. And I’ll see you down the road, hot boy. Bye.”</p><p>Bray Wyatt’s passing left a huge hole in the pro wrestling world. He was such a unique character that nobody will ever be able to totally fill it. Bray Wyatt had years left in his career and tons of stories left to tell. Sadly, he was taken from us far too soon.</p><p>Seth Rollins will continue, but he will never forget about Bray Wyatt. The two certainly told enough stories in the ring during their time together that they will always be linked in some way.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on Seth Rollins’ words about Bray Wyatt?
