He was born Daniel Michael DeVito Jr. and is named after his father. He is currently 78 years old and is famously four feet ten inches (147 centimeters) tall.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Some may not know…</strong></p><p>His height is the result of a rare genetic disorder called multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Also known as Fairbank’s disease, this disorder affects bone growth. However, this has never stopped Danny DeVito from reaching for the stars in his career.</p><p>DeVito went to boarding school and played roles in several plays. After graduating from boarding school, the actor attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He received glowing reports from his teachers and graduated from the academy in 1966.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/About-Danny-DeVito.png alt="About Danny DeVito" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span id=Theater_Career>Theater Career</span></h2><p>DeVito’s career began at the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center, which was located in Waterford, Connecticut. He starred in an off-Broadway production of One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest. The play was a direct adaptation of the book and ran in 1971. He also played roles in a number of plays that were produced by the Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective.</p><p>Despite his origins in the theater, the actor didn’t make his West End acting debut until 2012. He starred as Willie Clark in the Neil Simon play The Sunshine Boys alongside Richard Griffiths. The play previewed at London’s Savoy Theatre and ran for twelve weeks.</p><p><strong>Later nominated for an award…</strong></p><p>The actor made his Broadway debut in 2017 at the American Airlines Theatre. He starred in a Roundabout Theatre Company revival of The Price as Gregory Solomon by Arthur Miller. He proved that he was still able to hold his own on the stage and was even&nbsp;<strong>nominated for a Tony Award</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=TV_Career>TV Career</span></h2><p>Danny DeVito shot to fame in 1978 when he played the part of Louie De Palma in the series Taxi. His role as an endearingly domineering cab dispatcher immediately captured the hearts of NBC audiences. He played the role for five years until 1983 and won two awards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>But perhaps one of the most pleasant surprises for fans was when…</strong></p><p>In 2004 he played a surprise role as a&nbsp;<strong>stripper called Roy in the hit TV show Friends</strong>. This role allowed DeVito to use his talent for physical comedy to the full. The short but sweet role clearly proved that he can still steal any scene he’s in.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2006 he joined the cast of the hit TV show It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. DeVito plays the role of Frank Reynolds and is still starring in the show to this day. To date, he has appeared in more than 150 episodes of the popular series.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TV-Career.png alt="TV Career" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span id=Movies>Movies</span></h2><p>The actor has also enjoyed a long career on the big screen.
