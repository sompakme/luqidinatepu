Of course, the Mississippi native also happens to be a great role model when it comes to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">making money moves</a>. His stunning Atlanta estate, The Promise Land is proof of that. Every year Rozay invites friends and fans to his annual car show on the sprawling property. It also houses various animals and a beautiful mansion where he resides with his family.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The 47-year-old has never had a hard time flaunting his mass wealth with the world on social media or even giving out tips in his books. Ross' advice will surely help some people get off on the right foot financially. Still, it's unlikely that everyone will be able to achieve the feats he has, such as owning a private jet. Of course, plenty of stars own their own planes these days. However, not all of them have the opportunity to park theirs beside Donald Trump's.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rick-ross-continues-to-make-boss-moves>Rick Ross Continues to Make Boss Moves</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Monday (September 11), the Richer Than I Ever Been artist posted a new photo on IG. It showcases his jet parked in Palm Beach, Florida. On its own, Ross' jet is an impressive sight, but with the embattled politician parked behind him, it appears closer to normal plane size. Regardless of the size difference, the former correctional officer was simply feeling proud to be parked on "Billionares Row ðŸ¥‚" with Trump alongside him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Seeing as Donald Trump is looking at a substantial prison sentence after his most recent <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">arrest</a>, it's possible he won't be able to use his massive private jet for quite some time. On the bright side, there's potential that the former POTUS could be granted house arrest rather than having to serve time behind bars.
