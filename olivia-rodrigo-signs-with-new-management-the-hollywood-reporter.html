Her&nbsp;debut officially-promoted single “drivers license,” put out by Geffen/Interscope, shattered records in the first week after its Jan. 8, 2021, release. It broke Spotify’s global record for streams in a given week, soared to No. 1 on Apple Music in 48 countries and debuted at No. 1 on the&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Hot 100</strong></a>&nbsp;with the most streams and downloads of any song in the U.S.</p><p>Rodrigo’s follow up singles “Deja Vu” (No. 3) and “Good 4 U” (No. 1) made her the first artist in history to have their first three singles debut in the top 10 of the Hot 100. “Drivers License” and “Good 4 U” respectively finished 2021 as the Nos. 2 and 3-most streamed songs in the U.S. according to MRC Data.</p><p>Rodrigo&nbsp;released her debut album,&nbsp;SOUR, in May, hitting No. 1 on the&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Billboard 200</strong></a>&nbsp;chart, where it reigned for five non-consecutive weeks.&nbsp;SOURhas earned 3 million equivalent album units in the U.S., according to MRC Data. Nine of the 11 tracks on the album have reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Rodrigo now has seven Grammy nominations, including in each of the Big Four categories: record, album and song of the year and best new artist. She’s the second-youngest artist in Grammy history to be nominated in each of the Big Four categories in the same year. Only Billie Eilish was younger.</p><p>In April, Rodrigo kicks off her first nationwide tour, launching April 5 in Portland, Ore., before heading to Europe in June.
