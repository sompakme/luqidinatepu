Moreover, she recently confessed that she had a spat with Coi Leray over a failed collab and proximity to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her then-boo</a>, Blueface, that resulted in Rock throwing her phone in Coi's face. From what the Zeus Network darling expressed <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">on The Jason Lee Show in a new bombshell interview</a>, it seems like the Massachusetts MC was being "fake" in her eyes, trying to pretend like there were no tensions between them. Sounds like she just didn't want to take it that far, but alas, Rock had business to stand on.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I thought she wanted to do a collab on some music, but really she was just trying to out me out the plan and bag my n***a and some other s**t," Chrisean Rock expressed. "I'm like, 'You can have [him], I just want the verse.'...We fell out because she wanted what she wanted. She had a hidden agenda when she hung out with me." You can find this discussion around the 2:01:30 timestamp in the full interview below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chrisean-rock-s-full-interview-on-the-jason-lee-show-watch>Chrisean Rock's Full Interview On The Jason Lee Show: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Then, the Baltimore native claimed that she met the "Players" artist on a tour bus with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>GloRilla</a> earlier this year while she was still pregnant. "[Coi Leray] in everybody face," Chrisean Rock added. "She know we not cool. You can ask anybody that was right there. N***a, I took out my phone, I'll buy a new one, I threw that b***h at her face. She just wanna sit in my face and smile. I ain't know what it was. But I didn't give a f**k what it was."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, this conversation also ended up revealing a lot about the mother of one's current situation. She explained a lot of the headlines, antics, developments, and huge scandals that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">have defined her post-childbirth media space</a>. At least things are slightly better now, but it remains a pretty contentious and difficult spectacle to navigate.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaH15hJdmmqGqmaiyorqMq6aco12YvKp5y56pmrFdpbWwusRmq6Gqn6y2r7OMoaCpZZikvW66xLCq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
