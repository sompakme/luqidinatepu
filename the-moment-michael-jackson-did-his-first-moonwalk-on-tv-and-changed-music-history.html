He would whisper to people. [But] when he got onstage, he was like a general.”</p><p class=paragraph-text>Don said that after the show aired it had a huge impact and a few days later he saw just how much it had affected people.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The producer was in Washington to film an interview with the first lady, Nancy Reagan, and says he remembers, “Coming down the elevator [of the hotel], everybody’s talking about Michael. In the taxicab going to the White House, everybody was talking about Michael. In the East Wing [of the White House] … everybody’s talking about&nbsp;Motown 25&nbsp;and Michael.”</p><p class=paragraph-text>He added, “We do these kinds of things and we never know how people are going to react, but that morning in Washington … suddenly I said to myself, ‘This show really had an incredible impact.’”</p><p class=paragraph-text><a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> would later go on to discuss his own experience of his first moonwalk in an interview with <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> in 1993 and said he 'cried' after the performance.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I'm never satisfied," <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> said, "Even when I see something that I've done, and people say: 'Oh it was phenomenal'.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"When I did Motown 25, and I did the moonwalk for the first time, I was backstage crying afterwards because I was unhappy."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Oprah was stunned. "You cried!?" she said in disbelief.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"But then I was walking to the car there was this little boy who was like 12," Michael continued.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He was this little Jewish kid and he said: 'You're amazing! Who taught you to dance like that?'"</p><p class=paragraph-text>"And for the first time I ever felt like I did a good job," he concluded.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"Because I know children don't lie, and I just felt so good about it."</p><p class=paragraph-text>In the same 1993 Oprah Winfrey interview, Elizabeth Taylor also discussed her impression of Michael Jackson.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He is the least weird man I've ever known," the Cleopatra star said.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He is highly intelligent. Shrewd. Intuitive. Understanding. Sympathetic. Generous, to almost a fault of himself.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He just - if he has any eccentricities it's that he is larger than life. And some people can't accept that, or face it, or understand it."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Elizabeth Taylor added: "His talent on stage - on why I called him the king of pop rock soul music entertainment, whatever - there's nobody that can come near him; [or] dance like that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaJmiqba0wNJopKKbmJayrXnJmpqkq5%2BjfKe10ayrZqWfpLu4rcukZKanpKTEr3nVopuep11mhnl%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
