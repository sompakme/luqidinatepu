"LOL. @bransoncognac @lecheminduroi." Fans shared plenty of laughs in the comments section of the post. Others called on 50 to collaborate with Drake. "At this point we need Drake & 50 to team up for a track with Whoo Kid on the intro," one user wrote. Another added: "A drake and 50 track would take over the world."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-amp-rick-ross-pose-with-diddy>Drake & Rick Ross Pose With <a href=# class=text-word>Diddy</a></h2></span><p>MIAMI BEACH, FL - DECEMBER 31: (L-R) Drake, Sean 'Diddy' Combs' and Rick Ross attend Sean Diddy Combs Ciroc The New Years Eve Party at his home on December 31, 2013, in Miami Beach, Florida.
