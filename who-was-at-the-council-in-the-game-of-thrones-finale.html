Of course, that extended to the finale—much to fans' supreme irritation—but the show managed to throw in a welcome surprise by uniting the main cast with a few blasts from the past.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This council of "the most powerful people in Westeros" (that is, the surviving lords and ladies who individually represent the regions comprising the Seven Kingdoms) came together, ostensibly, to put Tyrion and Jon on trial for the conspiracy to murder Daenerys. However, the agenda quickly changed to appointing a new leader of the Seven Kingdoms, a title which ultimately went to...Bran. (I already told you, this lacks logic!) It was, however, quite enjoyable to see Sansa, Arya, Tyrion, Ser Davos, and Yara Greyjoy fraternizing with the likes of eternal loser Edmure Tully, Robin "the glow-up is real" Arryn, and Yohn Royce.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Let's break down who was there:</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Samwell Tarly, Howland Reed(?!), and Edmure Tully</h2><img alt="Sitting, " title="Sitting, " width=1350 height=1350 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-sam-edmure-1558377897.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At this point, <strong>Sam</strong> is merely a maester.
