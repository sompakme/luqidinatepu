Prosecutors are seeking up to 14 years behind bars for <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Christopher Worrell</a>, but his sentencing has now been canceled and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued under seal Tuesday. The Proud Boy was on house arrest in Florida after his release from a D.C. jail in November 2021. A month before his release, Worrell, who has non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, was found to have <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>“simply invented” medical emergencies</a> that led a judge to hold two top Department of Corrections officials in contempt. In October 2021, Worrell claimed authorities failed to approve a surgery for a broken pinky finger and withheld his cancer medication. Turns out, he didn’t need surgery at all—he apparently just wanted it because he didn’t like how his healed finger looked—and the DOJ found little evidence of mistreatment. Worrell’s attorney declined to comment to the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Associated Press</a> about his disappearance.</p><a class=ReadItAtLink href=# rel=noreferrer><span>Read it at </span><span class=ReadItAtLink__name>Associated Press</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfpb%2BwwcNmmaixXZi1s7XSraapoJWneri70aucpaRdq66vtdKhnKxlkpqzsL7EZpqaqJmpvK150aKmrWWjmru1sc2coKef</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
