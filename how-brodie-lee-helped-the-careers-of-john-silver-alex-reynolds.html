Several wrestlers and fans have paid tribute to Lee, sharing stories of how amazing of a human being he was.</p><p>Lee has helped several people during his time in AEW and that is especially true for The Dark Order. John Silver recently spoke in an interview with <a href=#>Sports Illustrated</a>, where he revealed how Brodie Lee helped both his and Alex Reynolds’ careers in AEW.</p><p>Silver said Lee helped both of them get contracts in AEW and detailed what took place after the two squared off against Cody Rhodes and Matt Cardona in a tag team match.</p><p>“A lot of people don’t know this, but after that match, Brodie was the one backstage telling everyone that the match was great and that we needed full-time deals, which we ended up signing. That’s just one example. There were so many other little ways he constantly went out of his way to help us. Brodie was an amazing person. I can’t picture him not being here.”</p><p>“Someone tagged me in that video [Huber’s last appearance on Being The Elite] on Twitter, and watching it has just made me cry. Tony Khan had this idea for us to be like Raven and Stevie Richards. So we had those moments where I’d say he was great and then he’d hit me, or he’d ask me to hold up his belt and then he’d knock me off the apron. Thinking about it just makes me so emotional. I never want there to be another ‘Exalted One.’”</p><p>The latest episode of AEW Dynamite was the Celebration Of Life for Brodie Lee and it was a huge success on all accounts.</p><p>Brodie Lee’s legacy will continue to live on and he will never be forgotten.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye49qZmlpX528uHnBq6adoZViuaaxjKGcpaiVmXq1tMRmmpqqlZq%2FtHnOn2Sjp5ijerS1y6%2Bcq2WRobK5edGesKennJnAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
