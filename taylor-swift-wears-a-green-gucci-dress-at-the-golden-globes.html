Swift, nominated for the awards tonight for her record-breaking Eras Tour movie, is giving all the sparkly snake vibes tonight.</p><p>The singer arrived on the carpet in Los Angeles just as it was about to endâ€”and her appearance on-screen was so quick I thought I had missed it. Swift hasn't attended the Globes since 2020, so her appearance tonight was highly hyped-up, even if she <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/travis-kelce-golden-globes-2024/>wasn't with</a> <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/travis-kelce-golden-globes-2024/>boyfriend Travis Kelce</a>. Luckily, her look did not disappoint. Now that I think about it, the entire ensemble gave serious Reputation-era vibes. "Look What You Made Me Do" superfans, our time is now.</p><p>She wore a custom-made metallic green gown by Gucci that looked like it was made entirely from liquid green sequins and featured a strappy backless design and a subtle sweetheart neckline in the front. Her accessories were kept simple as she opted for matching metallic green pumps and no necklace. She instead opted for a pair of dangly diamond earrings and a few chunky rings, all of which are by De Beers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UdFei4GY37567jjvTFxAud-1920-80.jpeg><p>The singer and possible Golden Globe award winner tonight in the Cinematic and Box Office Achievement category (fingers crossed) kept her <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/golde-globes-beauty-2023/>beauty look classic on the carpet</a>, but she went without several of her signature details. Her full-on bangs were worn straight (a deviation from the side-swept look she's been rocking recently), and her long blonde strands were fashioned into Old-Hollywood waves. Her skin was kept glowy and fresh. Her classic cat-eye was swapped out for a smokier brown edition with a sparkly golden inner corner for a touch of brightness, and her red lip was replaced by a berry-tinged lip gloss.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more photos of her look. I will keep looking at it until she drops Repuation (Taylor's Version).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJkSB94QkVqqQxGrzhvhBA-1920-80.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5KuPnGc9iKkPC7W23hqdQn-1920-80.jpeg><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
