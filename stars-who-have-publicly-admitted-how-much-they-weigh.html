"I was almost 140 forever and now I'm like 116 and it just feels good," Kardashian revealed in an interview with E! News (via <a href=#>People</a>). Kim claimed that the weight loss was all due to healthy eating and vigorous workouts.</p><p>Kim's older sister, Kourtney, also memorably revealed her weight in 2018.&nbsp;"I'm 98 [pounds]," the <a href=#>five-foot-tall</a> TV star said, after telling Khloe and a friend that she gained a pound in <a href=#>a deleted scene from&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Sister Kylie Jenner has also publicly spoken about her weight. In 2016, during a Q&A on her app, Jenner addressed some plastic surgery rumors, denying having had any work done on her butt. "I used to be 120 [lbs]. I was like 16, I was really skinny," Jenner said (via&nbsp;<a href=#>InStyle</a>). "Now I'm pushing like 136 [lbs] ... but it's alright, I like the chunkiness." Of course, Jenner's body later went through a major transformation when she became pregnant with daughter Stormi, and she allegedly hit 180 pounds at her heaviest, according to<a href=#>&nbsp;Life & Style</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtjZYZ2e9KtmKurXay1sHnHmq2eZaCqr621wqWwZpmUora1wMSdZKGnp2K6tq%2FHZquhnalixKa1xqFm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
