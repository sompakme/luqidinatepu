The feud originated from a 2022 incident when Consequence revealed his continued support for <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kanye West</a>, even after the rap superstar engaged in a months-long <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">tirade of anti-Semitic comments</a>. Kweli responded by sharing images of his Black Star cohort <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Yasiin Bey</a> in an altered version of Kanye's "White Lives Matter" shirt, instead reading "White Lies Matter." From there, the pair continued to exchange words on social media, eventually leading to Consequence airing out his frustrations on wax.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-consequence-released-a-track-titled-beef-forever>Consequence Released A Track Titled "Beef Forever"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The beef between Consequence and Talib Kweli seemed to reach a boiling point last week when the Queens-born lyricist <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">took to a record</a> to flame his opponent. The song, titled "Beef Forever," clocks in at just over 90 seconds and features a host of jabs directed at Kweli. On the track, Cons name-checks Kweli's ex-wife and references sexual harassment claims made against Kweli by rapper Res in 2018. The track features lyrics such as "You probably so afraid of that left from Eque, and that's the reason why them other girls got MeToo'd. You never been more than a Mr. Me Too."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After hearing the record, and, crucially, seeing that media personality DJ Akademiks had platformed the diss, Kweli responded via Instagram, accusing both parties of being right-wingers with a questionable history of sexual misconduct.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-talib-kweli-claims-consequence-amp-dj-akademiks-have-formed-an-alliance-against-him>Talib Kweli Claims Consequence & DJ Akademiks Have Formed An Alliance Against Him</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kweli's Instagram post included a video of DJ Akademiks agreeing with comments made by former president Trump, as well as a screenshot of Akademiks' support of the diss record. After humorously nicknaming the duo "DJ Wackademiks" and "Dexter," Kweli continued to call the new song trash and imply that the pair stand on an alliance with amoral figures such as nazis and rapists.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kweli continued dissing the pair in additional posts, including one that establishes a bizarre and disturbing pattern of behavior from both Ak and Cons, again maligning them as part of a boys club rife with sexual impropriety. In these posts, Kweli actively exposes photos of the pair hanging out with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tekashi 6ix9ine</a>, who has faced accusations of sexually assaulting a child.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-talib-kweli-exposes-dj-akademiks-for-an-alleged-sexual-assault>Talib Kweli Exposes DJ Akademiks For An Alleged Sexual Assault</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the midst of this beef, a woman has stepped forward <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">to accuse DJ Akademiks</a> of sexual assault, lending further credence to Talib Kweli's claims. After sharing several posts targeted at Consequence and the media personality, Kweli blocked the pair in an effort to end the discourse. Consequence saw this move as an act of retreat and shared a screenshot with the caption, "HE TAPPED OUT @talibkweli Blocking Pages Like A [B****]."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-feud-shows-no-signs-of-ending>The Feud Shows No Signs Of Ending</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the days since the release of "Beef Forever," the pair have actively exchanged words on social media, with no new ground covered. Both Consequence and Talib Kweli have continued to throw shots at each other, including each rapper claiming that the other has failed at their music career. Further, they argued that the other relies on this beef to maintain relevance. While some prominent rap figures have weighed in to mediate, it doesn't seem like either party is interested in squashing this war of words any time soon.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>TeeJay Small is a professional humorist, pop culture columnist, and an avid enjoyer of all things hip hop.
