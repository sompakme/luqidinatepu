However, some other rumors floating around are not as damning or serious, as this latest New Yorker exposé from Monday (June 11) about his abandoned $57 million Malibu mansion proves. Moreover, it specifically makes some claims about the renovations process around 2021. Apparently, Ye's future wife Bianca Censori hired contractor Tony Saxon right after the Chicago artist bought the then-$75 million property from architect Tadao Ando. In addition, it seems like Censori was Saxon's only point of contact in these beginning stages based on his recount of events.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, Bianca Censori said that Kanye West didn't want some of the home's wood to show. She allegedly instructed contractor Tony Saxon to paint over the shelves, cabinets, closets, and bathroom marble despite Saxon's grievances with how that would look. After some paint-testing, Ye decided to tear out the wood instead, and so Saxon and a friend ripped cabinets apart and left the laundry room bare. We wonder if the couple is as particular with these home instructions when they are <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">traveling</a> to other places around the world.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kanye-west-performs-at-rolling-loud-l-a-2024>Kanye West Performs At Rolling Loud L.A. 2024</h2></span><p>INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14: Rapper Kanye West performs onstage during the "Vultures 1" playback concert during Rolling Loud 2024 the at Hollywood Park Grounds on March 14, 2024 in Inglewood, California. (Photo by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images)</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Regardless, Tony Saxon said that he and Kanye West hung out often after they finally met, with the latter even gifting the former with a night's stay at Malibu's Nobu Hotel. But this didn't stop the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> mogul's requests from becoming more and more bizarre, and Saxon said he worked 16-hour days without sleeping and was so exhausted he had to nap on the property to make it. He gutted the kitchen and cleared all five bathrooms. One day, apparently, Ye woke Saxon up while standing over him and said, "I thought you'd be working." This is when their relationship allegedly began to sour, and might be the start of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Saxon's lawsuit against him</a> from last September.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, other of the former contractor's claims include Kanye West wanting to build a bomb shelter in the basement and requesting to keep the house without power and fully off the grid. They allegedly argued at a certain point over these, in Saxon's eyes, excessive requests and failure to pay for these services on time. Now, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the Malibu mansion remains empty and without a buyer</a>, and Yeezy Construction shut down last November. So this has a few different avenues of potential resolution in court, but it doesn't look on the best of terms.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.
