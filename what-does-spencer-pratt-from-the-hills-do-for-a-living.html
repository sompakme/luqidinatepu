He is the owner of <a href=#>Pratt Daddy</a>, a website where he sells healing crystals, bracelets, essential oils, and merch. Yep, Pratt is a bonafide crystal entrepreneur, and he's used Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok to get the word out.</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>Money</a>, Pratt's hustle has paid off big time. In 2018, he told the outlet he was selling hundreds of pendants weekly. The crystals in question are gems hand-carved by an artisan partner, whom he dubbed "The Picasso of the crystal game." At the time, Pratt revealed that if he announced a new crystal drop on Snapchat, the newly released gems would sell out in less than an hour.</p><p dir=ltr>Pratt, who fancies himself a hummingbird "whisperer," also peddles bird feeders and other gear. He told <a href=#>KatieCouric.com</a> that his small business started in 2017, when his wife Heidi Montag told him he could no longer buy more crystals for his collection. (He personally owned more than 1,000 of the gems at the time). Pratt added that his wife, who now manages the couple's finances, later told him that if he wanted, he could sell the crystals he had and use that money to buy more â€” and that's how his lucrative business was born. Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Pratt's business was raking in more than $350,000 each month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpjboZye9ahmK1llKSytHnSqZynm5WnerG%2BwK2rZp6ipLpuwMeeZKGhnKHAbrDOZp2oql2Weq211aKloGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
