They seem to be very happy with one another, and that has yet to change. The two even have a child together, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">in one of the worst-kept secrets of all time</a>. Throughout their relationship, the Youtuber-turned-rapper has always sought to protect Bailey. Whenever someone has something negative to say about her, you can be sure that he will clap back.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For instance, over the weekend, podcast Elijah Schaffer came out and said that there are a lot of "ugly" people in Hollywood now. He used an image of Halle Bailey as his example, claiming that her eyes are far apart and that she looks like ET the Extra-Terrestrial. If you go on Schaffer's Twitter account, you can see that he has a very bizarre beef with black people as a whole. This has led to people calling him racist, although Schaffer refuses to acknowledge that he may be the problem here.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ddg-shows-no-mercy>DDG Shows No Mercy</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Following his comments about Bailey, someone found a picture of Schaffer and his mother. The image was shared to Twitter, with many calling Schaffer's mom "ugly." Schaffer clapped back saying that she was suffering from a disease that altered her appearance. DDG subsequently used this explanation against Schaffer and disrespected his dead mother for the world to see. "I’m smokin on yo dead ass mama," the artist wrote. "That dumb bitch should’ve got a better doctor LMFAO." He even posted a picture of himself smoking a blunt, with the mom's face photoshopped to the end of it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Needless to say, DDG stands up for the mother of his child. Although some may say he went too far, others will beg to differ. Let us know what you thought of the rapper's response, in the comments section down below.
