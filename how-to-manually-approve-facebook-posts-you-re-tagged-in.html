You can also be tagged in posts, a feature that's commonly used when posting about meetups with friends or family members.&nbsp;Sometimes, spammers and marketers will tag you in posts, particularly from compromised accounts.</p><p>These tags will all show up on your timeline by default. They will appear beneath your name, photo, and bio information on your main profile. If a friend, family member, or colleague looks at your profile, they can see posts that you have been tagged in by scrolling down the page.</p><p>You may be tagged by friends, or you may be tagged by strangers. Once you're tagged in a post, your name will be visible to anyone who has permission to see that post. If the post is public, it could show up on your profile as public content (which means that anyone, friends or not, could see it).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Remove Your Facebook Profile From Google (and Other Search Engines)</a></span> If your account is set to <a href=#>allow search engines to find you and link directly to your profile</a>, a potential employer running a background check could stumble across any public posts that you've been tagged in.</p><p>One thing that won't show up on your timeline is individual comments that you are tagged in. So if your friend tags you in the comment section of a funny photo to draw your attention to it, the post won't show up on your profile.</p><h2 id=enable-timeline-review-to-manually-approve-tags>Enable Timeline Review to Manually Approve Tags</h2><p>Fortunately, you can take control of these tags and manually approve what appears on your timeline. By doing so, you can review everything that appears on your profile, avoiding any spam or <a href=#>unflattering photos</a> while also embracing the posts that you want your friends to see.</p><p>To do this, log in to your Facebook account on the web at <a href=#>Facebook.com</a> or via the mobile app for your platform of choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=enable-timeline-review-on-facebook-com>Enable Timeline Review on Facebook.com</h3><p>If you're using the website, first, log in to the Facebook website.&nbsp;Click on the downward-facing arrow in the top-right corner of the news feed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/main_menu.png><p>In the menu that appears, click on "Settings & Privacy," and then select "Settings" to show the full menu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/settings_menu.png><p>Click on the "Profile and Tagging" section in the sidebar on the left of the screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/profile_tagging.png><p>Under the Reviewing section at the bottom of the screen, enable "Review posts you're tagged in before the post appears on your profile?" by clicking the Edit button.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/more_tab.jpg><p>While you're here, you might also want to enable the "Review tags that people add to your posts before the tags appear on Facebook?" option to get even greater control over who can see your posts.</p><h3 id=enable-timeline-review-on-mobile>Enable Timeline Review on Mobile</h3><p>On mobile, the process is a little different, but just as simple.
