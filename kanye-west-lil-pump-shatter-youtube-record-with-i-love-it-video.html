The rapper&nbsp;had more to offer than just that, though. 'Ye debuted his music video for his new <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Pump</a> collaboration, "I Love It" featuring Adele Givens. The music video is ridiculous, to say the least, but ultimately, created some hilarious memes. A week later and their music video has shattered a major record on YouTube.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kanye West and Lil Pump's "I Love It" is now the biggest global debut for a hip-hop video on YouTube. The video garnered 76M views within the first week which surpasses the record previously set by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Childish Gambino</a>'s "This Is America." In addition to record-breaking first-week numbers on YouTube, the single has reportedly also garnered over 115M streams globally across all streaming platforms. It's a polarizing song but clearly, Kanye West and Lil Pump put together something infectious.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to Billboard, Kanye West and Lil Pump's "I Love It" is expected to debut in the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Billboard said that it has much to do with the 20M+ streams it received within the first week in the U.S.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lil Pump isn't the only new artist Kanye's been working with. Over the past week, Kanye West and 6ix9ine have been spotted hanging out together including in the studio. Kanye was also in Colombia this past week where he was, again, spotted in the studio with Tekashi&nbsp;6ix9ine. It's unsure when that collaboration will be released but we hope it comes with a visual as meme-able as "I Love It."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
