The actress was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, in the United States of America. At the moment, Britt Robertson age is 30 years.</p><p class=align-left>Britt is the oldest of seven children; she has three younger brothers and three younger sisters as well.</p><p class=align-left>The celebrated actress was raised in Greenville, South Carolina. She was homeschooled due to her mother's worries about the public school system.</p><p class=align-left><i>Pretty Woman</i> was the first movie the actress saw in theatres, and the film got her excited about acting. However, her choice to delve into the acting industry was fueled by watching soap operas, which eventually made her decide that she wanted to be an actress.</p><p class=align-left>She began acting at the Greenville Little Theatre, where<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> she performed plays</a> and small shows.</p><p class=align-left>When Britt was in elementary school,<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> she was discovered</a> by a Los Angeles talent agent during a convention at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9277a6feaa10d015.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rachel Reynolds bio: age, height, measurements, salary, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At 14 years old, Britt <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">moved to Los Angeles </a>with her grandmother to seek TV and film opportunities.

These friends made her stay in LA comfortable and even cooked dinner for her and did her laundry for her when needed to.</p><p class=align-left>Another fun fact about the actress' early life in Hollywood is that while she was in LA, she lived at the Oakland Apartments, a notorious hub for child actors and their stage moms. For the first years that she lived there, Hilary Duff and Frankie Muniz frequented the place. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">She once revealed</a> that,</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2e18039faba321c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bio of Madelyn Cline: age, height, TV shows, boyfriend, net worth</span></p></a>I moved to L.A., and I lived in the Oakland Apartments, which is this notorious hub for actor children and their stage moms...For the first few years that I lived there, Hilary Duff and Frankie Muniz frequented the apartments. I was much younger than them at the time. I would follow them around and try to be their friends and they would have no interest in me whatsoever. I was just such a big fan of theirs. I wouldn’t consider them really friends, but I definitely saw them and would stalk them like a weirdo.<p class=align-left>In April 2017 <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> interview promoting <i>Girlboss</i>, Britt talked about how growing up in the industry shaped her:</p>Being an actor you're constantly thrust into a world where you're giving people the license to talk about you and have opinions about you and your work...That alone creates a sense of success and failure and ups and downs. I've definitely had that. I've been lucky that I've been doing this for a really long time that it's all normal life to me now and I'm not greatly affected by it. But there was a point in time where I would feel if I failed, I would never be able to recover and it was the end. Whereas now what I've taken from the show is this idea that you don't have to be perfect. You can fail and you can s*ck. It takes a brave person to do that and to get up every day and still give it your best shot rather than just cowering with fear.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5830c66ea7342b1a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Victoria Principal's biography: age, net worth, where is she now?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e56e45b8c809e269.jpg><h2>Body measurements</h2><p class=align-left>Britt Robertson hot body is quite a sight to behold.

Not because I'm an actor, because I'm an awesome big sister.</li><li>If I can play 15 when I am 25, I can play 35 when I'm 55.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5830c66ea7342b1a.png><ul><li>I eat like no other, it drives everyone crazy. I eat donuts three times a day and I probably go through four Mountain Dews a day. I'm on like a sugar high at all times, pretty much. Shiri Appleby, who plays my mother, is a vegan and works out every day for two hours before she goes to work. When she sees me with my Mountain Dew, eating chips and a donut at 4 in the morning, she's like, "Wow. Wait until you're 30".</li><li>I like really bad TV; it's a problem. Love me some reality. Would I ever be on a reality show? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That would not be for me. My mom used to think it would be funny if I had a reality show: "It would be cute, we could call it Being B," because my family calls me "B." We're not doing that. We're not the Kardashians. I also love the Kardashians.</li><li>None of my friends really like to party. My best friend and I go to bed at 11 o'clock. We have such old lady schedules. Everyone's always like, "Let's go out!" And we're always like, "No, we don't want to". They call us the grandmas. L.A. can get really old really quickly if you waste your life away in a club all night.</li><li>My grandmother raised me for a good portion of my life. She moved to Los Angeles with me to be an actor, so I've always had a connection with an older generation.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8f1d6c77569ee1bf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing facts about the beautiful and talented Alice Eve</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Britt Robertson is an excellent actress with many accomplishments to be proud of.
