Actually, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the drama's been going on for a while</a>. Their fights have been documented on social media several times and it seems it's time the two went their separate ways. If Swae listens to his mother's advice, then this will be the case.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However,&nbsp;Swae is not prepared to patch things up so quickly, which may be due to the guidance of his mother.&nbsp;Mama Sremm posted an IG story directly calling out Marlie for her audacious antics: "@marlie IF ANYBODY TOUCHES MY SON I WILL PUT A BULLET IN YOUR HEAD MYSELF." Apparently she wasn't happy with DJ Akademik's coverage of the situation either because the second half of her message read: "@djakademiks since you giving this tacky bitch clout #bang." On top of this, Mama Sremm sent Swae a long text message about being careful which women he gets involved with so he doesn't end up with a "bum ass bitch."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/98/90/799098_493a7a3dab72fd8b24bcbe40a45523bf.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/06/21/022106_a82f1ad839bf66e089c404169c39e97b.jpg><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It appears his mom doesn't have much to worry about anymore because Swae has repeatedly stated that he is single. "I’m waaaaay to cute for drama I been SINGLE for a minute 2020 I’ll clear things up," he captioned two photos of himself on Saturday. "PS X CLOUT IS ONE HELL OF A DRUG !!!," he added. His mom echoed this view in a post of her own. Swae also commented on&nbsp;TheShadeRoom's post about this mess, "Single like this so I can find my soul mate." So Swae is on the search for a girl who won't smash his whips or threaten his life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/73/68/506873_6349791f2a56b08817e8b3425e844a32.jpg><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Staff Writer&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Noah's first interaction with hip-hop was in first grade when he bought Jay-Z's "The Blueprint,” which was quickly confiscated by his mother and replaced with Bow Wow's "Unleashed" as a compromise. Noah's favorite album is his playlist of Playboi Carti leaks. The greatest source of joy in Noah's life is anything Lil Uzi Vert does on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdibIV5hY9mqrCZlWK5prHSZqSopV2ptbOxwK2cp6tdnba0ecSxZLCgn2K9tsCMoaCtZZ%2Bjeqm10mafnpmUYrumw9I%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
