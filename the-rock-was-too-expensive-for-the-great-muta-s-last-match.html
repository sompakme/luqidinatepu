With the Japanese sensation set to take his place in history, an interesting revelation was made that Muta unsuccessfully tried to get a match with the Great One, The Rock.</p><p>The Rock has been credited as one of the greatest WWE superstars of all time. The People’s Champion then went on to conquer Hollywood after his nine-year successful stint in the company.</p><p>Even though The Rock hasn’t competed in a proper wrestling match in a long time, his name is still popular in the sport. Moreover, The Great Muta recently admitted that he attempted unsuccessfully to secure the Brahma Bull for his farewell match <a href=#>during an interview with ESPN’s Marc Raimondi.</a></p><p>It was widely reported earlier this year that The Rock was being courted for what may have been a fantastic dream bout by Pro Wrestling Noah executives and The Great Muta himself. Muta desired to face The Great One, however, he admitted to Marc Raimondi that the showdown against the WWE legend could not materialize due to monetary reasons with Muta calling it too expensive.</p><p>“I asked Muto about the report he was trying to get The Rock as his last match. He nodded and said, in English with a smile, “too expensive.”</p><p>The Great Muta will soon be immortalized after <a href=#>he successfully concluded his retirement tour. </a>The Japanese legend will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2023 during the WrestleMania 39 week and will etch his place in history forever.</p><p>What is your take on the dream match between The Rock and Great Muta?
