Overnight, Em made a tweet that reminded fans he's still a big fan of Wayne. "Bro Wayne just said “got a bunch of zeros like a bag of new funyuns!!” F*CK why didn’t I think of that????" Em's tweet reads. The lyric comes from a new song Lil Wayne appeared on alongside <a href=# class=text-word rel>YG</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Tyga</a>. The track is called "Brand New" and it appears on a playlist that the two California rappers just released together.</p><p>In the replies to Eminem's tweet, there are plenty of different reactions. Some have pointed out just how much the lyric does sound like something that Em would say in a song. Others pointed out their own favorite Wayne lyrics like when the rapper said “Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex. Cuz you don’t want that late text…that “I think I’m late” text.” One of the top replies to the post is a screenshot of the lyrics from the <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Thug</a> song "The World." The lyrics in question feature a similar lyrical reference reading "I leave a big ol' hole right inside you, n*gga, like some Funyuns."
