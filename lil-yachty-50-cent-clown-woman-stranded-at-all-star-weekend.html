The city of Atlanta lit up this past weekend as dozens of nightclub events were hosted by several of the hundreds of celebrities in town. We saw videos from just a few of the parties, as well as the not-so-pleasant occurrences from those looking for a come-up. There were a handful of photos floating around showing that while people were inside of the clubs, others were taking the tires off of their cars. Two people reportedly died over the weekend&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">including rapper Chucky Trill</a> who was reportedly shot and killed on a highway.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When there is a celebrity-centered event on the horizon, especially sports-related, models will do all they can to make sure they're seen. However, just because someone is flexing online doesn't mean they have the means to afford their travels, and often, people end up stranded. That's what was said to have happened to a woman who goes by "Yazz Theestallion."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I went to Atlanta for all star weekend with $400 only booked a one way because I was waiting on my unemployment to pay my way back but they baited I need help surviving and making back home to New York please anything will help!!!” she wrote in her original GoFundMe post that has since been deleted. She asked for a goal of $1,500 and after making $1,600 with the help of over 50 donors, her post was taken down.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Yachty</a> couldn't help but draw attention to "Yazz" over on TikTok. "Why did you go? You shoulda stayed home.&nbsp;Anybody that want to help this poor girl, they shouldn't because you shoulda stayed home." Then, he decided to scream it for good measure. "You shoulda stayed home!" <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a> couldn't help himself and had to weigh in, as well, over on Instagram.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Is this real [laughing emojis] or is somebody trying to pull some bullsh*t.
