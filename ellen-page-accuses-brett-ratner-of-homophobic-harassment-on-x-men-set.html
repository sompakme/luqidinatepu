I looked down at my feet, didn’t say a word and watched as no one else did either,” Page continued. “This man, who had cast me in the film, started our months of filming at a work event with this horrific, unchallenged plea. He ‘outed’ me with no regard for my well-being, an act we all recognize as homophobic. I proceeded to watch him on set say degrading things to women. I remember a woman walking by the monitor as he made a comment about her ‘flappy pussy.'”</p><p>Page’s story comes one week after six women, including actresses Olivia Munn and Natasha Henstridge, publicly <a href=#>accused Ratner</a> of sexual harassment or misconduct in a Los Angeles Times story. Ratner’s attorney, Martin Singer, dismissed the claims, and Ratner is <a href=# rel=noopener>suing</a> a woman who <a href=# rel=noopener>accused&nbsp;him of rape in a Facebook post</a>.</p><p>Ratner did not immediately respond to THR‘s request for comment on Page’s accusations.</p><p>Page, who began working in the industry at 10, also detailed harassment she was subjected to beginning when she was 16, including an incident in which one of her directors fondled her leg under a table at dinner.</p><p>“It was a painful realization: my safety was not guaranteed at work. An adult authority figure for whom I worked intended to exploit me, physically,” wrote Page. “I was sexually assaulted by a grip months later. I was asked by a director to sleep with a man in his late twenties and to tell them about it. I did not. This is just what happened during my sixteenth year, a teenager in the entertainment industry.”</p><p>The actress also said she regrets working with <a href=# id=auto-tag_woody-allen data-tag=woody-allen>Woody Allen</a> on his 2012 film To Rome With Love.</p><p>“I did a Woody Allen movie and it is the biggest regret of my career. I am ashamed I did this,” Page said. “I had yet to find my voice and was not who I am now and felt pressured, because ‘of course you have to say yes to this Woody Allen film.’ Ultimately, however, it is my choice what films I decide to do and I made the wrong choice. I made an awful mistake.”</p><p>Read Page’s full post:</p><p>“You should fuck her to make her realize she’s gay.” He said this about me during a cast and crew “meet and greet”…</p><p>Posted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Ellen Page</a> on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Friday, November 10, 2017</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSfnZGpwrOx0micpaSVo3qxrcaeZJqbk6rApr%2BMm6merKRiv6LAzZ6pZqCforyxtM6boJxlmJa%2For%2FSppynrF2teq6xzWaqnqxdZn12g49uamg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
