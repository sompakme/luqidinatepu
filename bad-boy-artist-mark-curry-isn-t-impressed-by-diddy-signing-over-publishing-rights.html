The LOX, Ma$e, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Faith Evans</a>, 112, and the estate of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>The Notorious B.I.G.</a> are all expected to have the publishing rights to their music returned to them. The announcement was foreshadowed by Ma$e's podcast co-host Cam'ron who broke the news on Instagram that Ma$e would be getting his rights back.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As it turns out, not every rapper involved is happy with the arrangement. One of the label's former artists Mark Curry, is calling the move an empty gesture. He posted a video to Instagram reacting to the move. In the video, he claims that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a> held onto the rights for as long as they had value and then signed them over after. "That’s disrespectful. I said why don’t you just keep it and pay me? I don’t want the publishing; I want the money," he said in the video. He elaborated in the caption. "Diddy gave the publishing back.:. So what.. it has no value… I want him to give me a million cash and then I can plan the rest of my life out well," it reads.

It was just announced this week that he would be honored with the Global Icon award <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">at next week's MTV VMAs.</a> The award will be accompanied by a performance from the rap legend.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That appearance comes at a good time as Diddy just announced his feature-packed new album. The project will contain the final ever feature from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>The Weeknd</a> alongside a number of other impressive collaborations.
