While speaking during “<a href=#>The Black Announce&nbsp;Table</a>“, Bron Breakker revealed he was also informed in advance he was going to be part of the ceremony.</p><p>“I actually never got a phone call. Nobody told me like clear-cut, ‘You’re doing it.’</p><p>I heard that they announced them and I knew that I was going to be a part of that in some form or fashion and I just kind of assumed that I was going to be the one to induct them, but they didn’t really tell me until like a couple days before — a day before — I can’t really remember, but I just remember not knowing until we were kind of going.”</p><p>Bron Breakker successfully defended his NXT Championship at NXT Halloween Havoc. We will have to wait and see what is next in store for the young star.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on the Steiner Brother’s WWE Hall of Fame induction?
