She is <a href=#>famously known </a>for creating some of the most realistic paintings.</p><p class=align-left>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">describes her work</a> as follows:</p>Using filters such as glass, vinyl, water, and steam, I distort the body in shallow painted spaces. These filters allow for large areas of abstract design - islands of colour with activated surfaces - while bits of the human form peak through [...] I am exploring the possibility and potential where representational painting and abstraction meet - if both can coexist in the same moment.<p class=align-left>The artist creates visuals that are unusual, interesting, and utterly captivating. One of her best paintings is the one with a girl smiling. The textured layers and detailed details in the smirk on a woman with water on her face make the picture both intriguing and unexpected.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/170213e49dfdb833.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 popular Chinese anime shows to add to your watchlist</span></p></a><h3>5.

He became popular in the 1990s by creating art that talked about important topics and things happening in society. He became known worldwide in 2004, when he created <i>Mona Lisa: the Design of a Smile</i>.</p><p class=align-left>His version of the Mona Lisa is especially unique because it's incredibly realistic and one of the best examples of hyperrealism. While comparisons to actual images are unavoidable, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Leng Jun</a> argues that everyone who views his works in person can identify the difference.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, the artist argues that the worth of anything, or artwork, lies in its irreplaceability. As a result, replicating a photograph is pointless. In his opinion, the <a href=#>feelings and expressions</a> that an artwork depicts are what genuinely make a painting successful.</p><h3>6. Seven Chambers by Jason de Graaf</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9dce43907566bd4f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33 best underwater movies for aquatic lovers of all genres</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e9c0788d9ca6f74b.jpg><p class=align-left>The <i>Seven Chambers</i> painting by Jason de Graaf stands out as some of the most realistic art in the world. Jason de Graaf, born in 1971 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, specialises in hyper-realistic still-life paintings in acrylics.</p><p class=align-left>Describing his artwork, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he stated:</a></p>My paintings are about staging an alternate reality, the illusion of verisimilitude on the painted surface, filtered so that it expresses my unique vision. Though my paintings may appear photoreal, my goal is not only to reproduce or document faithfully what I see one hundred per cent but also to create the illusion of depth and sense of presence.<p class=align-left>Jason began his painting profession by studying various images and designs in college. His interest in art grew after a prominent artist and illustrator offered him a demonstration of hyperrealistic painting.</p><h3>7. Study of Hands by Luiz Escañuela</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2c002f33c4a4b97d.png><p class=align-left>Luiz Escañuela is one of the youngest talented painters whose work has not yet been widely recognised.

His mastery of painting techniques, his understanding of light and his interest in figuration have made him produce some of the best realistic paintings.</p><h3>8. Auspicia by Robin Eley</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/170213e49dfdb833.jpg><p class=align-left>Robin Eley is one of those people who will bring your imagination into reality through his paintings.
