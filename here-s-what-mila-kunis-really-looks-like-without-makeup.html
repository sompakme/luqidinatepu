In December 2012, she appeared makeup-free following a massage session in Studio City, California, per <a href=#>E! News</a>, and in 2016, the actor was photographed with very minimal makeup for <a href=#>Glamour Magazine</a>. But this wasn't a particularly new experience for Kunis, who said, "I don't wear makeup. I don't wash my hair every day. It's not something that I associate with myself." But according to her, there's no shame in opting for a full face. She continued, "I commend women who wake up 30, 40 minutes early to put on eyeliner. I think it's Â­beautiful. I'm just not that person."</p><p dir=ltr>But Kunis did spill one reason why she doesn't wear makeup on a daily basis. In 2014, she told <a href=#>Harper's Bazaar</a>, "I think because I have to do it everyday for work, when I don't work I get out of the shower I don't do anything to it." And Kunis doesn't want her pictures dramatically photoshopped either. She told Glamour, "I hate it. There was a company that I did a photo shoot for once that manipulated the photo so much, I was like, 'That's not even me.' Like, what's the point?" However, Kunis is not opposed to a little finessing on camera. She explained, "Now, do I sometimes want them to depuff my eyes? Help me out with a little bit of lighting."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm5kaYZ3e8eeqZ6rXay1osCMpqClmV2gwq%2B10mapnpmcocZuuM6ooqxlnJ64pnnWoquhp6Wpeq6typ6sqWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
