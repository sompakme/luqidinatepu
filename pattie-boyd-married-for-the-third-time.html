The groom looked smart in a coordinating suit, with a silver tie and a white rose in his button hole.Fans will be hoping it is third time lucky for Pattie. She met George Harrison on the set of A Hard Day's Night in 1964, when she was cast as a schoolgirl in The Beatles' first film. Two years later they were married, when she was 21 and George was 22, and he later wrote the song <strong>Something </strong>for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c36e234178f2-pattie-boyd-george-z.jpg><p id=e8cV3mAdMY1K data-wc=8><strong>Pattie Boyd with her first husband George Harrison</strong></p><p id=eTzt5rbRrCnI data-wc=90>It was by no means the only song she inspired. Eric Clapton, who pursued her passionately, wrote about her refusal to leave George for him in his hit song <strong>Layla</strong>.In 1974, Pattie did eventually leave the Beatles star for a new life with Eric – and he wrote his most famous ballad, <strong>Wonderful Tonight</strong>, for her. It wasn't to last however, and in 1984, five years after they married, Pattie left Eric.She later met Rod, describing him in 2007 as "very supportive", "comfortable to be with" and "very good looking".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/29c0a4cfffe3-pattie-boyd-eric-z.jpg><p id=el1ZLG7p_cX1 data-wc=5><strong>Pattie Boyd with Eric Clapton</strong></p><p id=e2ZttE6IUWf3 data-wc=30>"I realised that I could actually stand up to a man and he wasn't going to desert me – so I thank him for that," she said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZmtoYWp9dnyQa2tyb2hkvaLA06KcZpqfrrFuucCrqaKdo2K%2FsLCMsJysrJ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
