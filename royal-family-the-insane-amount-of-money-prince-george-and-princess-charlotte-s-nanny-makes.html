While the trio's parents, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are known for being very hands-on when it comes to their children, it's sensible for the couple to take on extra help which can alleviate the pressures that come with their hectic work schedules.</p><p>Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo has been the nanny to the Cambridge children since each of them were small, having started working for the family eight years ago when <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Prince George</a> was a few months old in 2014.</p><p>The famous college where she studied is widely considered to be one of the best institutions in the world as it lands their graduates in hugely successful and highly paid jobs working for everyone from celebrities to the royals.</p><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>Prince William sang songs from this popular band to Prince George as a baby to get him to sleep</b></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article22026904.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_1.jpg><p>Maria is originally from Spain heralds from the city of Palencia. She received her formal training at the prestigious <a href=# rel=nofollow>Norland College</a>, located in Bath.</p><p>The college website reads: “Norland offers world-class training to those aspiring to be the very best professional childcare practitioners.”</p><p>In order to be accepted onto the £15,000- a year course you must have at least three Cs at A-Level and be able to show a passion and commitment for caring for young children. While that sounds easy enough, the college only welcomes around 100 pupils a year.</p><p>The subjects that are taught at the school have previously been described as a mix between 'Mary Poppins and James Bond' as students will learn everything from self defence, martial arts and getaway driving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article22191137.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-696976240.jpg><p>When students graduate after four years, they will certainly be excited at the future opportunities that lie ahead of them as Norland Nannies are always in high demand.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>FEMAIL</a>, newly qualified nannies can earn up to £42,000 for a non-residential role while some earn up to £120,000 after a few years' experience. This attractive salary also includes the benefits of designer handbags, trips abroad and luxurious living quarters.</p><p>The Principal at the college, Dr Janet Rose, said: "Amongst many traits, Norland Nannies need to be loving, kind, honest, creative, practical, responsible, organised and willing to continually learn and improve in order to do the very best for the families and young children with whom they work.</p><p>"We aren't looking for an in-depth knowledge of babies and young children because we will teach them this. Instead we're looking for what we can't teach – an absolute commitment to being the person that changes the world through shaping the life of the children they work with."</p><p><b><i>Have a story you think we should be covering?
