You can, however, help carry out their plans. You can put the modified FEV into the water purifier, which was part of their ultimate plan for it in the first place.<h2>Can you join the Enclave in Fallout 2?</h2>You can't join them in the second game, because they don't let anyone 'join' them. You're born into the enclave, or you're an enemy of the enclave. Plenty of games had music in the 90's lol & the atmosphere of the soundtracks in Fallout 1 & 2 is amazing.<h2>Can you join the Enclave in Fallout 76?</h2>To join the Enclave and unlock the path to your own set of X0-1 power armor you'll need to reach the point in the campaign where you have the mission Bunker Buster as an option. That will start you on the path to locating the Enclave and end with you launching a nuke and basically unlocking an end game world.<h2>Can I join Brotherhood and Enclave Fallout 76?</h2>While in Fallout 4 you decided whether to side with the Minutemen, the Brotherhood of Steel, the Railroad, or the Institute, in Fallout 76 you can actually join all of the available factions – after all, there's nobody around to call you out for your betrayals.<h2>Here's Why You Should Join the Enclave in Fallout 76</h2><p></p><h2>Can you join both factions in Fallout 76?</h2>There are two factions you can join, and each one has their own storyline in the Wastelanders expansion for Fallout 76. Depending on your choices, you can become friends (or enemies) with both of these groups, and each one has some very cool rewards to unlock.<h2>Does Fallout 4 have Enclave?</h2>No, the enclave is, sadly, dead. They have had their main base destroyed and any remaining outposts were wiped out by the NCR and BoS. Any that went east were destroyed by the BoS and Liberty Prime. Putting them in Fallout 4 would just be beating a dead horse.<h2>Can the Enclave join Mr House?</h2>Even though Arcade Gannon supports the idea of the Courier fighting for an independent New Vegas, there is no dialogue option to explicitly get the Enclave remnants to fight for New Vegas's independence, nor to assist Mr. House, who is similarly opposed to both the NCR and the Legion.<h2>Can you ever side with the Enclave?</h2>You cannot join the Enclave or side with them, it would have been more interesting if you could but you are forced to side with the BoS. Yeah, there is even a moment where Eden pretends you'd have a place in the Enclave but it's just a trick. Joining the brotherhood is the only ending to the game and cannot be changed.<h2>Is the Enclave in Fallout 3?</h2>The Enclave are featured as the main antagonists of Fallout 3, fighting against the Brotherhood of Steel for control of the former capital.<h2>What factions can you join in Fallout 3?</h2><p>Fallout 3 factions</p><ul><li>The Enclave.</li><li>The Brotherhood of Steel.</li><li>Talon Company Mercenaries.</li><li>Brotherhood Outcasts.</li><li>Vault Dwellers.</li><li>Raiders.</li><li>Super Mutants.</li><li>Reilly's Rangers.</li></ul><h2>How do I start I am death?</h2><p>"I Am Become Death" Quest - Fallout 76</p><li>Explore the Whitespring Command Center.</li><li>Complete all the Nuclear Training tutorials.</li><li>Speak to Modus.</li><li>Acquire a nuclear code piece.</li><li>Search the archives for info on the Launch Code Encryption.</li><li>Launch a nuclear missile. (Optional) Nuke Fissure Site Prime (8+ Player recommended)</li><h2>How do you get promoted in the Enclave in Fallout 76?</h2><li>There are several ways to obtain commendations: "Basic Combat Commendation": This can be earned by killing Epic Creatures with three or fewer stars next to their names. Rewards one commendation. ...</li><li>Once you earn enough commendations, you'll be promoted automatically and the quest will conclude.</li><h2>Is the institute like the Enclave?</h2>On the one hand, the Institute is mostly concentrated within the Commonwealth, while the Enclave is more dispersed across the former United States, although their numbers decreased substantially because of the protagonists we play between Fallout 1-3.<h2>Is the Enclave still active?</h2>Yes and no. The Enclave as a major power in the Wastes is long gone, their power shattered in both the West and East Coasts, however there still remain remnants of these factions.<h2>What happens if you restore the Enclave radio?</h2>Shutting it down (the short-circuit option) will unlock a nearby safe containing the "X-02 Devil's Inferno" mod for the X-02 power armor alongside other loot. Restoring Enclave Radio instead will make it available as a new radio station, but will make the safe inaccessible.<h2>Do you get power armor from the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 76?</h2>The Mire. A Power Armor station can be found around the back of the gas/petrol station. You'll find the Power Armor standing on the Brotherhood of Steel plate, by the two empty Power Armor stations in the middle of the base.<h2>What happens if you don't join the Brotherhood of Steel?</h2>If you dislike the Brotherhood, you can choose not to join and you'll always be able to change your mind or continue with the questline. Also, joining any faction will not cause you to become enemies with another until you reach a breaking point in that questline (such as the Mass Fusion quest and End of the Line).<h2>What is the best faction to join in fo76?</h2>Most players seem to prefer sticking with the Settlers up until they get access to the Chinese Stealth Armor. After that — and particularly toward the end of the game — they'll side with the Raiders, since maxing out Raider reputation opens up the Gauss Minigun as well as the ArmCo Ammunition Construction Appliance.<h2>Should I side with the settlers or the Raiders?</h2>Choosing Settler or Raider<p>There are rewards on BOTH sides that are quite sought after by players, and when faced with the choice, they believe they can only choose one. I've had countless players ask me WHICH faction to choose, and the answer is simple: Choose Both.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaxn6p6q7vIp2StoJVisq%2Bvy5qtng%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
