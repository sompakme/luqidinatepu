This is accurately reflected on the official website for the City of Flint, and in MLive Flint Journal candidate surveys dating back to 2001, 2007, and 2014.”</p><p>Then came the blame game.</p><p>“Any legislative biography that said otherwise was a compounded oversight made by a political staffer,” the statement added. “Mayor Neeley has worked to set the record straight.”</p><p>Neeley’s office did not immediately respond to a voicemail seeking comment on Thursday. But the Fox story pointed out that at least as of early this week, a slew of online biographies clearly stated the mayor had a bachelor’s degree in communications. Among them: his biographies on Legistorm—a database on state and federal politicians and legislation—and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.</p><p>Both biographies had been amended to indicate the mayor simply attended the school by Thursday afternoon. The bogus claim that he received a bachelor’s was still visible, however, on <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>the text of a resolution passed by his then-colleagues in the state legislature in 2019</a>, honoring his ostensible achievements. The ABC affiliate also reported that the mayor’s official website biography indicated he had a bachelor’s degree prior to being revised in 2021.</p><p>In a city that has been gutted by a historic water poison crisis and plagued by routinely sky-high crime rates and a legacy of police violence, catching the city's top elected official in a lie about a basic biographical fact is remarkable in its own right.</p><p>But it also comes at a delicate time for the mayor, who, as MLive <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>noted</a>, faces a potentially tight re-election bid against a predecessor, former Mayor Karen Weaver, in the November general election. Neeley defeated Weaver by just over 200 votes in 2019.</p><p>The controversy also comes just weeks after, as The Daily Beast <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>reported</a>, Flint police tased a handcuffed woman twice. Police at the time declined to identify the officers who used force that day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfm7mqutNmpJqxn6d6tLTEpZuopl2jsqa4xLJkm6SRorK0edKtmJ%2Belad6orLTnqlmm5%2BhuaazxGabnp%2BimrJur8uaoKZlla29sL%2FEnWSaq12qu7W%2B1J4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
