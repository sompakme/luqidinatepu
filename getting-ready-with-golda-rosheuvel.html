This probably explains why she always looks to be having so much fun on the red carpet, and doesn't feel afraid to push the style boundaries.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her most recent look was a particularly special one. The actress attended designer Huishan Zhang's Chinese New Year celebration this week at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://georgeclub.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Club," class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">George Club,</a> where she wore a beautiful blue dress. The silhouette marked a departure from Rosheuvel's go-to styles, but it was a perfect choice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I wanted to celebrate my figure, which I haven't done before, and this brand and outfit gave me the confidence to do that," she explains, going on to praise Zhang for having the perfect "blend of feminine, classic and a bit of an edge" in his collections.</p><img alt="golda rosheuvel" title="Golda Rosheuvel" width=2000 height=3001 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/golda-65ccd80f98229.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Hollie Molloy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, Rosheuvel tells us about her style icons, when she feels her most beautiful and how much she loves it when a great look comes together.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Please talk us through your look – what drew you to this particular outfit?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My look is a dark blue dress that's very shapely, which is not my usual cup of tea, but I'm throwing caution to the wind and celebrating my figure. It's slightly scary, but I thought why not, it's 2024.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The dress has these amazing beautiful balloon sleeves and a tie-back bow. I wanted to celebrate my figure, which I haven't done before, and this brand and outfit gave me the confidence to do that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's important to keep on pushing yourself and telling a story, it's the same avenue as acting, to be able to tell a story confidently about women's bodies and celebrating a brand that does that."</p><img alt="golda rosheuvel" title="Golda Rosheuvel" width=3280 height=4928 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/goldarosheuvelxhz-016-jpg-65ccd8de14820.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Anna Stokland</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">How do you decide which brands you want to work with?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For me, it's about choosing a brand which makes clothes I love, but also aligns with the story I want to tell. It has to align with the celebration of the female body, with black bodies – I'm a biracial woman, so I have parts of me that are more accentuated. I'm not a size eight, I fluctuate and I'm at that age now going through things like menopause, so to be able to work with brands that give me confidence is so important."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">What makes Huishan Zhang such a great fit for you and your personal style?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's such a blend of feminine, classic and has a bit of an edge. I love it."</p><img alt="golda rosheuvel" title="Golda Rosheuvel" width=2000 height=3001 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/golda-2-65ccd80f7175f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Hollie Molloy</span><p>With designer Huishan Zhang</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">How involved do you tend to be with the styling process?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm very involved, from the first moment. With Zhang, I knew what I wanted to wear and how I wanted to look. It's all about being open to different ideas too, rather than just sticking to the one you have in your head."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">What kind of fashion makes you feel your most confident?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When something allows me to be me, which is a little bit out there and slightly pushing those barriers and boundaries. It's not about being noticed, but rather about sparking conversation. That's what's really interesting in fashion, and my acting career is similar to that too. I choose the roles that spark conversation and push boundaries, I want also to express that through the clothes I wear and the brands I work with."</p><img alt="golda rosheuvel" title="Golda Rosheuvel" width=3280 height=4928 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/goldarosheuvelxhz-070-jpg-65ccd8ded9d3b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Anna Stokland</span></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">How has your style evolved over the years?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I've always taken this approach to fashion, which comes from not having anything. I've spoken about this a lot over the years, where I had only £5 in the bank when I was a struggling artist. Despite that reality, I always made sure I looked confident in the clothes that I wore. I used to find pieces in thrift shops and put different outfits together – it doesn't matter what you're wearing, it's more about how you feel."</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">What has been your most memorable fashion moment in recent years and why?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Of course being in the [Harper's Bazaar] magazine, that was a very cool moment. Attending the BAFTAs was also such a highlight, as I've never worn anything like that before. I wore a breastplate made of diamonds worn over a black chiffon dress, designed by Carolina Herrera."</p><img alt="golda rosheuvel" title="Golda Rosheuvel" width=3280 height=4928 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/goldarosheuvelxhz-015-jpg-65ccd8dc40fe8.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Anna Stokland</span></p><img alt="golda rosheuvel" title="Golda Rosheuvel" width=2792 height=4195 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/goldarosheuvelxhz-028-jpg-65ccd8db2fd95.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Anna Stokland</span></p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Whose style have you always admired and why?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I love Tilda Swinton – she has always been really interesting to me, as well as Helena Bonham Carter for the same reason, they're both people who make a statement and spark conversation. Then I love men's fashion as well, especially Harris Reed who is so unique. I'm attending his show for London Fashion Week, which will be my first time so I'm looking forward to seeing what he comes up with."</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">What is your ideal getting-ready set-up?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Lots of laughs and music. I always have music playing, whether it be country, R&B, jazz or pop. It's also all about when nobody takes themselves too seriously, it has to be a fun environment."</p><img alt="golda rosheuvel" title="Golda Rosheuvel" width=3280 height=4928 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/goldarosheuvelxhz-041-jpg-65ccd8dc0976d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Anna Stokland</span></p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">When do you feel most beautiful?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I know that the look has celebrated everybody involved – I know I'm representing my make-up artist, stylist and hair stylist. I feel most empowered, confident and beautiful when everything has come together. I was at a premiere recently in Los Angeles for an animation, where I was able to take my hair stylist with me. Everyone was complimenting my hair and she was standing next to me, and it was so wonderful to give her all the credit."</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Fashion has a reputation for being frivolous, but why does what we wear matter?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's the confidence through owning yourself with the clothes. My journey up to this point has a lot to do with the clothes I've worn and what I've chosen to put together. It's so important to celebrate fashion and not diminish it – fashion is connected to emotion and who I am in the world and what I want to speak about, and that shouldn't be taken lightly."</p><img alt="golda rosheuvel" title="Golda Rosheuvel" width=3280 height=4928 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/goldarosheuvelxhz-075-jpg-65ccd8dc3bf27.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Anna Stokland</span></p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1tcG5oZn53e8aoo52ZXae8tLTErq2epF2dwqq%2Fx5qlZrKYlruoew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
