The Dolphins tank season is being supported by many fans who believe the team needs to do horrible in order to secure some top draft picks.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a>&nbsp;recently caught up with <a href=# class=text-word rel>T-Pain</a>, who is a born and bred Floridian. Back in 2009, T-Pain worked with the Dolphins&nbsp;to rerecord the official fight song. The&nbsp;TMZ&nbsp;reporter took that as a hint that T-Pain was a Dolphins fan, but it doesn't look like that is the case.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>According to&nbsp;T-Pain, he isn't really a big sports guy in the first place. "I been associated with them, don't have to be a fan to get money," T-Pain stated of his affiliation with the Dolphins. When the reporter asks if T-Pain gave up on the team for being so bad, he jokes and says he stopped associating with them because they stopped offering money. He admits that he isn't a "team" person, and has no allegiance to any franchise unless they are paying him. T-Pain also suggests that players aren't even fans of their own teams, and that they are just there to make money.
