In the past, she's worked alongside <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>, Drake, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chief Keef</a>, and many more. Recently, however, she decided to go outside of her comfort zone to join Zach Bryan onstage. The country artist was performing in her hometown of St. Louis earlier this week when he brought her out. Of course, she showed off some of her signature moves, twerking and dropping it low as the crowd went wild.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The moment was pretty unexpected, but nonetheless, fans are here for it. Some even think Sexyy Red should try her hand at country music now. After all, the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">crossover</a> has worked out for <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Beyonce</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Nas X</a>, and more. She thanked Bryan for inviting her in a Tweet today, also sharing various fun photos and clips from the evening. "When you from the hood but you got ah country friend," she captioned a shot of her and Bryan.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-is-sexyy-red-in-her-country-era>Is Sexyy Red In Her Country Era?</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Sexyy also let her fans know "how a hood b*tch pull up to a country concert," flaunting an outfit consisting of denim shorts, a cropped jacket, and a pair of sneakers. Of course, she also topped the look off with her signature "Big Sexyy" chain and some shades. It remains unclear whether or not she and Bryan plan to hit the studio together anytime soon, or if her recent appearance was just for fun. Either way, they both <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">seemed to have a blast.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Bryan even posed for a few photos alongside the femcee, holding <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">two large stacks of cash</a>. "True, damn, you making noise boy Thank you @SexyyRed314_ and thank God for St. Louis, Missouri," he wrote. What do you think of Zach Bryan inviting Sexyy Red to join him onstage in St. Louis?
