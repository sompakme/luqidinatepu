During the chop&nbsp;up, Cannon asked his&nbsp;guest to explain why&nbsp;interracial&nbsp;couples is frowned&nbsp;upon according&nbsp;to Louis Farrakhan's teachings.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Rizza&nbsp;begins by defining love as being "supreme"&nbsp;gift from the heavens that transcends race. Then explains that interracial marriage "is not ideal" for the Black man&nbsp;since "you have to have a Black man and a Black woman"&nbsp; to manifest the best from a Black man. The conversation eventually mentioned the history of Black American men's relation to&nbsp;white women. Nick recalled how Black men used to be lynched for simply having looked at one, citing this atrocity to why the contemporary Black man pursue white women since interracial relationships became.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"White women are looked at as success," Cannon explained. "In America, we see a white woman&nbsp;â€” 'I couldn't have you. My daddy couldn't have you. My granddaddy couldn't have you. I would get killed even looking at you.' So, now, if I play for the NBA, I want 'em all."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After noting how white women actively participated in the rape of male slaves and the continued oppression of the Black man and his family in recent US history, Rizza continued to expound his&nbsp;narrative in response.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So you're telling me, the Black woman who has been there for us the whole damn time, who was there for us when we were getting lynched, who was there for us when we were getting whipped, every day, who was there for us to heal our wounds, to give us consolation of mind, to give us peace and quiet of mind, to help us to get through another day, you telling me she doesn't deserve at least...if you can give up on a Black woman so easily, you don't deserve no other woman because you have demonstrated you can't give enough love to who needs it most."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The continues to explain how marriage is a coming together of culture as well as resources. Given the history he mentions, he does not see the benefit or logic in the desire to&nbsp;withhold&nbsp;one's resources from its own community, especially&nbsp;while overcoming struggle. Nick Cannon then argues that he can continue to uplift his community in other ways.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiZYNxhJJmpaKbm2KworrNqKVmnJmosLa%2F0p6qZq%2BYnsGmedaopJ6mXZbAbr%2FYppmopKNivKd50q6anJ2jqHqnu9FmmaWZk6B6rrHNZqWer6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
