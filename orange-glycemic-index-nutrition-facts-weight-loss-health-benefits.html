These add-ins can dramatically increase the glycemic index of the beverage, and people living with chronic conditions like diabetes should be mindful of consumption. When selecting a juice product, look for freshly squeezed orange juice and review the nutrition label to determine if other ingredients have been added to the mixture.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>The below glycemic index and glycemic load data is for 100g of raw navel oranges:¹ ²</p><p><h3>Glycemic Index</h3></p><p><h3>Serving Size</h3></p><p><h3>Carbohydrate* per Serving (g)</h3></p><p><h3>GL per Serving</h3></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/6541526f723fdd8ff92255e3_pexels-jessica-lewis-creative-820905-p-500.webp alt sizes="(max-width: 991px) 90vw, 47vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=food-h2>Nutritional Facts</h2><p>Besides vitamin C, oranges are full of potassium and folate, two essential nutrients. Potassium supports heart, muscle, and bone health, while folate (a B vitamin) helps make red blood cells and DNA. Oranges also supply small amounts of calcium and magnesium.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>The below nutritional information is for 100g of raw navel oranges.²&nbsp;</p><p><h3>Calories</h3></p><p><h3>Carbs</h3></p><p><h3>Protein</h3></p><p><h3>Fiber</h3></p><p><h3>Cholesterol</h3></p><p><h3>Vitamins</h3></p><p>C (59.1 mg), A (11 µg), B6 (0.06 mg), Folate (25 µg)</p><p><h3>Sodium</h3></p><p><h3>Total Fat</h3></p><h2 class=food-h2>Health Benefits</h2><p>According to research studies, regularly consuming citrus fruits, like oranges, can benefit your health in many ways.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/6541526f723fdd8ff92255df_pexels-pixabay-158053-p-500.webp alt sizes=100vw style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3 class=food-h3>Helps with Hydration</h3><p>One navel orange provides approximately four ounces (121 grams) of water.²&nbsp;<a href=#>Fluid needs</a>&nbsp;vary based on age, activity level, and health conditions, but generally, women need 92 ounces of fluid daily, while men need 124 ounces.³&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Oranges are a water-rich food and can help you meet your daily fluid requirement. Proper hydration ensures that you:</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><ul><li>Avoid dehydration</li><li>Maintain an optimal body temperature</li><li>Digest food properly</li><li>Flush out waste and toxins</li></ul><h3 class=food-h3>Improves Digestion</h3><p>One medium-sized navel orange provides three grams of&nbsp;<a href=#>fiber</a>. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends consuming 28 g of fiber daily.⁴ Fiber has several health benefits, including aiding digestion, helping to regulate blood sugar levels, and satiating appetite levels.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>By including oranges in your diet, you can reap these benefits while ensuring you meet the recommended daily fiber requirements.</p><h3 class=food-h3>Supports Immune System</h3><p>One medium navel orange contains nearly 100% of the daily recommended vitamin C intake for men and even more for women. Vitamin C supports the immune system and helps with the production of collagen.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A 2021 research study found that citrus juice, mainly orange juice, supports the immune system by reducing&nbsp;<a href=#>inflammation</a>.⁵</p><h3 class=food-h3>Aids with Iron Absorption</h3><p>The vitamin C in oranges also helps the human body absorb iron, which enables the body to utilize oxygen more efficiently and avoid fatigue. Iron is especially important for premenopausal individuals who lose iron when menstruating.⁶ Iron is also essential for those who follow a plant-based diet since the human body absorbs iron from plant-based foods less readily than from animal sources.⁷</p><h2 class=food-h2>Are Oranges Good for Weight Loss?</h2><p>Oranges are an incredible fruit choice for those looking to lose weight. However, while orange juice is one of the most consumed beverages in the United States, it differs from consuming whole oranges.¹⁴ One cup of pure orange juice contains almost double the calories of a whole orange and twice as much sugar.² ¹⁵ Also, orange juice has less fiber, so it’s less filling and could lead to excessive calorie consumption.² ¹⁵</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A medium-sized navel orange can contain up to 2 grams of&nbsp;<a href=#>fiber</a>. The fiber content in these oranges can help reduce cholesterol and belly fat (visceral fat).&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A 2022 study tracked the food habits of almost 1,500 people with metabolic syndrome who were classified as overweight or obese. The researchers found that after 12 months, people who increased their fiber intake reduced their body weight and visceral fat.¹⁶</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Also, oranges contain flavonoids, a compound with several antioxidant properties. A 2017 study found that high intakes of flavonoids can help reduce fat mass.¹⁷</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Some ways to enjoy oranges include:</p><ul><li>Eating it as a whole fruit</li><li>Adding them as a topping to overnight oats, salads, stir-fry, or slaw</li><li>Zesting orange peels to add flavor to dishes</li><li>Juicing an orange for a marinade or soup</li></ul><h2 class=food-h2>Are Oranges Safe for People Living with Diabetes?</h2><p>Oranges are a safe choice for people living with diabetes due to their low glycemic index and low glycemic load ratings.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Oranges are rich in insoluble fiber that adds bulk to stool and improves digestion. Fiber helps slow down the absorption of carbohydrates after eating and can help decrease dramatic increases in blood sugar levels. One review of fifteen studies found that fiber can help reduce fasting blood sugar and HbA1c levels in people living with type 2 diabetes.¹⁰</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A medium-sized navel orange also supplies 12% of the daily recommended value of folate. Some studies suggest that folate may lower insulin levels and improve insulin resistance, blood sugar management, and symptoms of diabetes-induced eye diseases.² ¹¹ ¹² Oranges also contain 6% of the daily recommended value of potassium, which can decrease the risk of insulin resistance.² ¹³</p><p>Get more information about weight loss, glucose monitors, and living a healthier life</p><p>Thank you!

Symptoms of an orange allergy include itchiness of the mouth, lips, or throat, swelling, and redness. In severe cases, allergic reactions can cause hives, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis. Please consult a healthcare professional if you suspect an allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance to oranges.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Outside of an allergic reaction, oranges can also pose the following risks:</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><ul><li>Aggravating symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</li><li>Increased heartburn</li><li>Indigestion</li><li>Interactions with certain prescription drugs</li></ul><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>If you are concerned about adding oranges to your diet, please consult your healthcare provider.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/6541526f723fdd8ff92255eb_pexels-suzy-hazelwood-1937743-p-500.webp alt sizes="(max-width: 991px) 90vw, 47vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>No items found.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLXGp6asZpOkunCyzqibrGefp66vs8RmnqWxk5q6qq%2BMoqWdnag%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
