However, he "left the proof on her cheek".</p><p>And I was only eight years old that summer<br>And I always seemed to be in the way<br>So, I took myself down to the fair in town<br>On Independence Day</p><p>The girl sees herself as just another nuisance to her father, and heads off to the fair that is in town.</p><p>Well word gets around in a small, small town<br>They said he was a dangerous man<br>But mama was proud and she stood her ground<br>She knew she was on the losin' end</p><p>In a small town, word does spread quickly, especially when it's by word of mouth, and the girl knows this. Her father is seen as a drunkard and a "dangerous man". They also feel sorry for the girl.</p><p>Some folks whispered some folks talked<br>But everybody looked the other way<br>When time ran out there was no one about<br>On Independence Day</p><p>Everyone talks, and most people whispered, but nobody does anything about the girl's bad home situation.</p><p>Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing<br>Let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning<br>Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong<br>Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay, it's Independence Day</p><p>The "white dove" represents peace, love and friendship, and the Fourth of July is also seen as Independence Day.</p><p>Well she lit up the sky that fourth of July<br>By the time that the firemen come<br>They just put out the flames and took down some names<br>And sent me to the county home</p><p>The girl's mother, finally unable to take any more abuse, then sets the house on fire, and dies in the fire, along with her abusive husband. The firemen simply put out the flames and take some names down. As for the girl, she is now an orphan and is sent to the county home.</p><p>Now, I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong<br>But maybe it's the only way<br>Talk about your revolution<br>It's the Independence Day</p><p>The girl (now a woman) doesn't condone or dislike what her mother did. The last lyric then says, "Talk about your revolution, it's the Independence Day".</p><p>Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing<br>Let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning<br>Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong<br>Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay, it's Independence Day</p><p>Roll the stone away, it's Independence Day</p><p>This is such a great song! :) It's a very philosophical song, very deep, and thought-provoking, too. Kudos to Martina for writing this fantastic song! :)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZqaZoqm2r62MppqbqpmZsnC1zZ2cqZ2embKvr8Rmm5qx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
