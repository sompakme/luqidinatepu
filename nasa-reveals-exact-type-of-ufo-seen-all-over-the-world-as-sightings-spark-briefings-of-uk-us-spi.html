as the mystery sightings spark a rare briefing.</p><p>Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, director of US Department of Defence's UFO task force, shared <a href=#>declassified footage</a> of the exact size and shape of UFO that experts are "hunting" for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/world-eerie-new-declassified-ufo-811351783.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-13.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NASA-1.png><p>Nasa held its first public meeting on its study of UFOs on Wednesday ahead of a landmark report expected later this summer.</p><p>The 16-member panel - made up of top experts from scientific fields ranging from physics to astrobiology - has been tasked with probing mystery events in the sky.</p><p>Sharing his latest findings with the panel, Dr Kirkpatrick revealed that the majority of UFOs spotted are metallic spherical orbs.</p><p>They are usually seen at an altitude between 10,000ft and 30,000ft, and up to four metres in size, he explained.</p><p>"The vast majority of what has been reported and what we have data on - a little less than half now - are orbs round spheres," he said.</p><p>"This is the thing we are out hunting for in most cases."</p><p>As an example, Dr Kirkpatrick shared declassified footage of a metallic orb in the Middle East in 2022 by an MQ-9 Reaper.</p><p>He described it as "a typical example of the thing that we see most of".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>He added: "We see these all over the world and we see these making very interesting apparent manoeuvres.</p><p>"This one in particular, however, demonstrated no enigmatic technical capabilities and was no threat to airborne safety.</p><p>"While we are still looking at it, I don't have any more data.</p><p>"Being able to come to some conclusion will take some time until we can get better resolved data on similar objects that we can then do a larger analysis on."</p><p>Last year, an incredible image captured by a US spy plane <a href=#>showed a metallic orb UFO flying over Iraq</a>.</p><p>The picture - captured in 2016 - was included in a classified briefing video shown to American government agencies.</p><p>Dr Kirkpatrick said his task force - the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office - receives between <a href=#>50 to 100 new reports every month</a>.</p><p>But he explained that the number of sightings which are "possibly really anomalous" are 2 per cent to 5 per cent of the total database.</p><p>UFOs are dubbed as UAP for "unidentified anomalous phenomena" by the US government.</p><p>And experts revealed that the limited high-quality data and lingering stigma over UFOs pose huge barriers to unravelling the mysteries.</p><p>Nasa officials said several of the panellists had faced "online abuse" and harassment since beginning their work in June last year.</p><p>Nasa's science chief, Nicola Fox, said: "It is really disheartening to hear of the harassment that our panellists have faced online because they're studying this topic.</p><p>"Harassment only leads to further stigmatisation."</p><p>David Spergel, chair of the Nasa team studying UFOs, added that many commercial pilots remain "very reluctant to report" UFOs due to the lingering stigma around such sightings.</p><p>UFOs and UAP have moved from the realm of conspiracy theories to be regarded as a US national security problem.</p><p>Nasa's study is separate from the Pentagon's probe into unidentified aerial phenomena, which has been studied by US intelligence officials.</p><p>Wednesday's briefing was the panel's first public meeting a&nbsp;year after launching the study into unexplained sightings.</p><p>The independent panel of experts includes 16 scientists and experts selected by Nasa - including retired astronaut Scott Kelly, the first American to spend nearly a year in space.</p><p>Answering one of the most commonly asked questions during the briefing, Spergel said: "We haven't found life beyond Earth yet, but we're looking."</p><p>And Nasa's Dan Evans said after the meeting: "I want to emphasise this loud and proud: There is absolutely no convincing evidence for extraterrestrial life associated with unidentified objects."</p><p>Astronaut Kelly said optical illusions can help explain some of the sightings.</p><p>He described the moment he was flying off Virginia Beach years ago when his radar intercept officer in the back seat was convinced they had flown past a UFO.</p><p>Kelly said: "It turns out it was Bart Simpson, a balloon.</p><p>"And in my experience, the sensors kind of have the same issues as the people's eyeballs."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The group is examining what unclassified information is available on UFOs and how much more is needed to understand what's going on in the sky.</p><p>The final report is expected by the end of July.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdoZ4J5gpZpZqeZo5Z6s7HVnpilq12pxrGxjK6dqGWjmrKvecClo2anppq%2FbsDHnmSwp6KhsXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp -
