Fox Foundation website</a>, <a href=#>Michael J. Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease</a> in 1991 at the age of 29. It wasn't for another seven years that the actor would <a href=#>share the news with the public</a>. In 1998, Fox launched his campaign for increased Parkinson's research, and in late 2000, he founded The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. According to its website, the foundation is the world's largest non-profit funder of Parkinson's drug development.&nbsp;</p><p>While Fox took some time away from acting in the early 2000s to focus on his non-profit, he returned to the craft in 2013, starring in his self-titled television series, <a href=#>"The Michael J. Fox Show."</a>&nbsp;Since then, he has appeared on ABC's "Designated Survivor," Paramount's "The Good Fight," and many other shows. He has received a number of accolades for his work, including the 2011 Hoerzu Magazine Golden Camera Award and the 2010 National Association of Broadcasters Distinguished Service Award, per his website.</p><p>Ahead of being formerly awarded the Golden Camera Award, the magazine noted the honor was not being given just for Fox's work in front of the camera. "With this award, however, we want to do more than pay tribute to this actor's artistic achievements that have entertained us for decades. We want to express our great admiration for the way he continues to fight Parkinson's disease both personally and through the work of his foundation," they said in a statement to <a href=#>Variety</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2xka4Rye9ahnKdlp5bAbrnInJ%2BanZxit26yzrFknaGRnLuwv8SdZLChpJ16sa3RpKCnq5%2BjwG6wyKycmquVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
