He was "resting comfortably" and was being treated at a Las Vegas hospital. Anderson had previously dealt with heart issues and was open about his recent weight loss journey. On January 21, 2022, his publicist Glenn Schwartz announced on <a href=#>Deadline</a> that Louie Anderson had died. Fellow comedian and friend Pauly Shore shared on Twitter that he had visited Anderson at the Las Vegas hospital to say goodbye (via <a href=#>Page Six</a>).</p><p>It's a heartbreaking end to a comedic icon who very clearly adored his career. Per the <a href=#>New York Post</a>, Anderson previously stated that he loved "the anatomy of a joke" and compared it to archeology. <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;writes that as one out of 11 children in a poor household, he used both food and comedy to cope. Anderson said that he felt "very good" onstage and found it "healing." He is survived by his sisters, Lisa and Shanna Anderson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDk2pna2tfqbWmeceemKusXay%2FprrCoaCnn12ZsqLAx2amn2WcpMKqsYyapZ2doqi8r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
