Shining brightly on <a class=hm-link href=#>Amal Alamuddin</a>'s finger was her brand <strong>new wedding band</strong>, which appeared to be made of platinum. <a class=hm-link href=#>George</a>&nbsp;also flashed his matching ring as he waved to crowds from the water taxi which was carrying the overjoyed newlyweds down Venice's Grand Canal.</p><p id=eIwB-U4xc98h></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2b02fb07482a-rings1-z.jpg><p id=ewhLfeIW4wa6 data-wc=7><strong>Amal Alamuddin and <a class=hm-link href=#>George Clooney</a> debuted their wedding bands</strong></p><p id=essDYiPmZlls><strong></strong></p><p id=ecXw9elKD8q0 data-wc=32>The couple were said to be heading to the luxurious Hotel Cipriani – where the majority of their A-list guests were staying – for a <strong>post-wedding lunch</strong> with their family and friends.</p><p id=ev3qpfBZIeDN data-wc=106>As George, 53, and Amal, 36, navigated their way on the blue waters, the couple were clearly besotted with each other. The lovebirds waved to fans but spent a large part of the trip embracing and gazing affectionately into each other's eyes. <a class=hm-link href=#>George and Amal married</a> on Saturday 27 September with the actor's spokesperson confirming to <strong>HELLO! Online</strong> that they wed in a <a class=hm-link href=#>"private ceremony"</a>.While details of the bride's wedding dress is still unknown, there's little doubt that Amal will have stunned on her big day. The stylish Londoner showed off her impeccable taste in her <a class=hm-link href=#>first appearance as Mrs Clooney</a>, wearing a white embroidered Giambattista Valli thigh-skimming dress adorned with red and pink flowers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/77e972eea7aa-rings2-z.jpg><p id=e9y2aSyn8pdL data-wc=12><strong>Newlyweds George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin only had eyes for each other</strong></p><p id=ebBcl56dOmv6 data-wc=83>George <a class=hm-link href=#>popped the question</a> to his human rights lawyer love at the end of April, after a whirlwind seven-month romance. The pair tied the knot just five months later in Italy, the place where they first met at a charity event. Amal's dainty wedding band comes as a new addition to accompany the <a class=hm-link href=#>sparkling engagement ring</a> which George presented to her earlier this year. She was first spotted debuting the rock – an exquisite <a class=hm-link href=#>seven-carat diamond</a>, reportedly worth £450,000 – in mid-May, when she flew back to London after <a class=hm-link href=#>holidaying with George in Malibu</a>.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
