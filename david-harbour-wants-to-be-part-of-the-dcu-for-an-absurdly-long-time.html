The actor has been confirmed to play the role of Frankenstein, an undead soldier with enhanced abilities. It’s a role the actor hopes to wear for a long time.</p><p>This won’t be the first time that David Harbour has been in a comic book movie. He’s a member of the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Marvel data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Marvel</a> Cinematic Universe, having appeared in 2021’s Black Widow. He played the role of the aged Russian super-soldier, The Red Guardian, which he’ll reprise for the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=upcoming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>upcoming</a> film Thunderbolts.</p><p><strong>“I think it’s something where I just love these worlds so much that it’s a joy to do and a joy to work with someone so creative. So, if they want me to do eight to 10 years of this, I feel like I’ll check my schedule, but I’ll try to free up some time.”</strong></p>-David Harbour on playing Frankenstein for <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=DC data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>DC</a><p>As is the trend with comic book movie franchises, DCU leader James Gunn is trying to establish a universe connected by movies and <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=television data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>television</a>. So, while Creature Commandos will be an animated TV series, Gunn aims to be just as connected as the movies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seven-soldiers-frankenstein-1-900x551.jpg><p>With this connected universe in mind, David Harbour might be doing more than a voice role. He may be showing up in a DCU live-action movie or TV series. It’s a possibility that Gunn felt he had to make Harbour aware of.</p><p>According to an interview via <a href=#>Collider</a>, David Harbour spoke with<a href=#> James Gunn</a> about the character’s possible future. Even though Harbour didn’t know much about Creature Commandos, he was aware of the challenges that come with playing a comic book character. He also confessed his love of working within such creative worlds.</p><p>Harbour stated, “I think it’s something where I just love these worlds so much that it’s a joy to do and a joy to work with someone so creative. So, if they want me to do eight to 10 years of this, I feel like I’ll check my schedule, but I’ll try to free up some time.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-upcoming-david-harbour-projects><strong>Upcoming David Harbour Projects</strong></h3><p>David Harbour does have a busy schedule beyond comic book movies. He still stars as Hopper on the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Netflix data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Netflix</a> series Stranger Things. He also has plenty of film roles, having recently played a drunk and vicious Santa Claus in 2022’s Violent Night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/david-harbour-violent-night-900x561.png><p>Create Commandos is based on the DC Comics ensemble of monster heroes. The animated series will feature the team led by Amanda Waller, who also manages the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Suicide Squad" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Suicide Squad</a>. And, yes, Viola Davis will voice Waller, reprising her role from The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker.</p><p>With Waller present, Creature Commandos will have established ties to other DCU TV projects. Waller will return for other DC TV shows, including her spin-off simply titled Waller.</p><p>The Frankenstein that David Harbour plays will be more akin to the comics than the Mary Shelley book character. The comic book character is more of a ragtag soldier. So, it’s Frankenstein if he went on missions that required him to fire guns and work with other monster heroes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seven-soldiers-frankenstein-3-900x1389.jpg><p>Not much else is known about Creature Commandos at this time. It will be animated, but it’s not certain if it’ll be intended for families or strictly for adults. Given Gunn’s work on irreverent Peacemaker, it will likely be intended for adult audiences, more akin to Warners Bros’ Harley Quinn animated series.</p><p>Whatever the show is, Harbour seems on board for whatever James Gunn has planned, even if it spans many years. Creature Commandos is currently set for a release in 2024.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ickau2pXnHmqmbp6WneqWvjJ%2Bpmqabmru0wMSipWegpKK5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
