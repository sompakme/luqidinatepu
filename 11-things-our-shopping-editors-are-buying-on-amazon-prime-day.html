The brand’s toothpastes are baking soda-based (hence the whitening effects), so they don’t have the traditional mint flavor of other formulas and may take some getting used to. Once I adjusted to the flavor and texture, I came to enjoy it more than any other toothpaste — it has a neutral taste and a foamy consistency that leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean — and now I prefer it. The brightening results on my teeth became an added bonus. Thanks to a 42 percent Prime Day discount, the toothpaste I’ve been loyal to for a decade is just $7 for a two-pack, so I’m stocking up while I can.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hero Mighty Pimple Patch</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Chloe Anello, Senior Commerce Editor: </strong>I got married last month.

I basically played a game of whack-a-mole with the zits that kept popping up; each time I spotted a new one, I'd immediately apply one of these patches until it disappeared.
