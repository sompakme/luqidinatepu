Imagine them as your entrance options for a choose-your-own-adventure novel:</p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:40><strong>Option 1: The Terms of Service Tango</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:361>This one's pretty straightforward. You might encounter this scenario when signing up for an electronic filing service provider (EFSP). Just make sure the terms of service clearly state that agreeing to them constitutes your consent for e-service. <strong>Basically, you're saying "Yes, please!" to digital documents by clicking a button.</strong> Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.</p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:37><strong>Option 2: The Fancy Form Fandango</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:344>Feeling a bit more official? You can use a snazzy form called "Consent to Electronic Service and Notice of Electronic Service Address" (form EFS-005-CV, for those who like acronyms). This little gem lets you formally declare your e-service enthusiasm. <strong>Think of it as throwing a digital confetti party to celebrate the end of paper madness.</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:237><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Always make sure you provide your <strong>accurate</strong> electronic service address in whichever method you choose.
