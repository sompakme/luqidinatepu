He will be a part of the January 8th episode, but he was actually around for RAW this week.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News previously reported that CM Punk</a> was backstage at the Day 1 RAW. It seems that he showed up, even though he wasn’t booked. This is either a sign that WWE needed him around for another reason, or Punk really likes showing up to work that much that he is making the trip even if he’s not scheduled to appear on television.</p><p>It was not noted that CM Punk will do during the January 8th episode of WWE RAW. He is scheduled to compete in the 2024 Men’s Royal Rumble match on January 27th.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News</a>&nbsp;will be providing live play-by-play coverage of tonight’s show over in our&nbsp;<a href=#>WWE Monday Night RAW coverage&nbsp;hub</a>.
