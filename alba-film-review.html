A mostly wordless, beautifully understated study of the multiple growing pains of a <span data-scayt_word=cripplingly data-scaytid=2>cripplingly</span> shy 11-year-old girl, the film follows a series of <span data-scayt_word=Barragan data-scaytid=3>Barragan</span> shorts on the theme of troubled childhood. It is loaded with <span data-scayt_word=weepie data-scaytid=4>weepie</span> potential but diligently shuns the facile at every turn, playing it for an emotional truthfulness which is embodied in a fine, trembling central performance by <span data-scayt_word=Macarena data-scaytid=5>Macarena</span> Arias and in its sensitive, empathetic script. Alba has been garnering festival plaudits, most recently at Toulouse’s Latin American film platform, but deserves more.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Alba (Arias) lives with her divorced mother (<span data-scayt_word=Amaia data-scaytid=6>Amaia</span> Merino), ill and bedridden and part-reliant on her daughter for practical help. Following a collapse, her mother is hospitalized and committed to the care of Alba’s loner father Igor (Pablo <span data-scayt_word=Aguirre data-scaytid=7>Aguirre</span>), who looks as though he’s been having a rough time of it: In one touching scene, Alba is shocked to discover a picture of him soon after her birth, looking radiant and handsome.</p><p><span class="lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-display-block">The Bottom Line</span> <span class="c-span u-font-size-22@tablet u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-family-secondary">A quiet little heartbreaker.</span></p><p>The business of living is already painful enough for someone as excruciatingly inward-looking as Alba, even without having to go and live in the run-down apartment of a father who appears as damaged as she is (in Igor’s case, his inability to communicate sometimes comes across as indifference towards his daughter) and whose best as a parent is actually pretty useless.</p><p>But Alba’s real sufferings take place at school — a costly-looking establishment place, presumably funded by the mother’s side of the family -— where all the other girls seem well-adjusted and confident. Alba is the butt of their cruelty, bus sometimes of their kindness, too, and seems equally baffled about how to deal with both. Out of the blue, a classmate called Eva (<span data-scayt_word=Fernanda data-scaytid=8>Fernanda</span> <span data-scayt_word=Molestina data-scaytid=9>Molestina</span>) befriends the girl, and she is invited to party.</p><p>This major event in Alba’s limited life, which becomes the film’s main focus, brings with it a whole separate set of pressures to deal with, pressures guaranteed to raise troubling memories in the minds of viewers whose own childhoods were plagued by the same maelstrom of psychological and social insecurities as Alba’s is.</p><p>The shyness, of course, means little <span data-scayt_word=dialogue data-scaytid=10>dialogue</span> — Alba speaks to nobody but her mother (and herself) until 25 minutes in, and the narrative advances through the accumulation of telling scenes. Several, for example, have Alba stealing small things of significance from houses she visits to suggest that she’s seeking emotional bonds with a world beyond her own. But not all the symbolism is as subtle, and scenes featuring insects of beauty -— a ladybird being eaten by ants, a butterfly being crushed — come over as obvious and unnecessary, given the emotional authenticity of what surrounds them in a film whose mood is defined by the permanent threat of heartbreak.</p><p>It’s the delicately modulated subtlety of Alba that sometimes makes it so moving: On the day that he takes charge of her, there is a side-shot of Igor just closing his eyes, which is all you need to know about how unprepared and overwhelmed he feels about the task now facing him. Equally well-done is the in-car <span data-scayt_word=dialogue data-scaytid=11>dialogue</span> in which father and daughter accidentally learn that they have something in common, his daughter’s eyes full of wonder that such a thing could be possible.</p><p>Given that she’s playing a character who is all about isolation and solitude, Arias’ performance — she is present in every scene — is amazingly communicative, and it’s not just about the expressiveness of those large doleful eyes, or the frailty of a body that seems to want to shy away from all human contact, it’s about how well she has been directed by <span data-scayt_word=Barragan data-scaytid=13>Barragan</span> for the nuances.</p><p>Editing, unusually by a team of four, is sharp and cadenced throughout, delivering tension and, over the final stretch, pace to the kind of story which is too often presented with shots of lengthy self-indulgence — something which is never an issue here. The ending, as understated as everything that’s come before, is well-judged -— for a moment, the story becomes Igor’s as well as Alba’s — but feels a little too neat, failing to raise the rather huge question of what will be next for this socially maladjusted but intriguing couple.</p><p>Production companies: <span data-scayt_word=Caleidoscopio data-scaytid=20>Caleidoscopio</span> Cine, <span data-scayt_word=Leyenda data-scaytid=21>Leyenda</span> Films, <span data-scayt_word=Graal data-scaytid=22>Graal</span> Films<br>Cast: <span data-scayt_word=Macarena data-scaytid=15>Macarena</span> Arias, Pablo <span data-scayt_word=Aguirre data-scaytid=16>Aguirre</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Amaia data-scaytid=17>Amaia</span> Merino<br>Director-screenwriter: Ana Cristina <span data-scayt_word=Barragan data-scaytid=18>Barragan</span><br>Producers: Isabella <span data-scayt_word=Parra data-scaytid=27>Parra</span><br>Director of photography: Simon <span data-scayt_word=Brauer data-scaytid=28>Brauer</span><br>Production designer: Oscar <span data-scayt_word=Tello data-scaytid=29>Tello</span><br>Costume designer: Ana <span data-scayt_word=Poveda data-scaytid=30>Poveda</span><br>Editors: <span data-scayt_word=Yibran data-scaytid=33>Yibran</span> <span data-scayt_word=Asuad data-scaytid=34>Asuad</span>, Juan Daniel <span data-scayt_word=Molero data-scaytid=35>Molero</span>, Ana Cristina <span data-scayt_word=Barragan data-scaytid=31>Barragan</span>, Jose Maria <span data-scayt_word=Aviles data-scaytid=37>Aviles</span><br>Casting directors: Maya <span data-scayt_word=Villacreses data-scaytid=38>Villacreses</span>, Julia Silva, Raul <span data-scayt_word=Teba data-scaytid=39>Teba</span><br>Sales: <span data-scayt_word=Caleidoscopio data-scaytid=32>Caleidoscopio</span> Cine</p><p>Not rated, 89 minutes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSrnaaesri%2Fjpqjm5ldm7atuYyrnK%2Bhlax6eYWXcGdxZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
