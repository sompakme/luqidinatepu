And the Roman Catholic Church covers all of his living expenses, as well as the salary of his personal secretary. The former pope is also still covered by the Vatican's private health care policy, according to the Independent. As for his leisure activities, Benedict said he would spend his time praying, reading, watching the news, and playing with his <a href=#>cats</a>, as&nbsp;<a href=#>USA Today</a> reported.</p><p dir=ltr>In all, it's a much better retirement plan than the last pope who resigned. As <a href=#>Britannica</a> reports, when Pope Celestine V called it quits in 1294 after just five months in the papacy, his successor, Pope Boniface VIII, worried Celestine would pose a threat and imprisoned him in a castle.
