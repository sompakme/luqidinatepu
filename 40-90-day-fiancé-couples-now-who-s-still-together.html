Basically, two people from two very different parts of the world fall in love, whether through talking in an online chat room, a chance encounter on a mission trip, or a one-night stand that turned into something more.

It's exactly as chaotic as it sounds—but, funnily enough, it has lasting results. Seven seasons and seven spin-off show laters, including&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?,&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days,&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé: What Now?,&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk, and&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way,&nbsp;a lot of couples have had a chance to tell their love story.
