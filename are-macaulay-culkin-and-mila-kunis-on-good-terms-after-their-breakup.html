Speaking on the <a href=#>"WTF With Marc Maron"</a>&nbsp;podcast, the "Bad Moms" actor dished that they're not on good terms following their split. "[We're] probably not as friendly as we could be, no," she said. "There are too many aspects of it that just prevented us from ever moving forward [from the] past. We dated from when I was like, 18, 19 until 25ish."</p><p>Apparently, their breakup was largely her fault, with the star detailing in an episode of Dax Shephard's <a href=#>"Armchair Expert"</a> podcast that she regrets how she dealt with everything back then. While she was a bit stingy on the details, she implied that she wasn't on her best behavior. "I had a horrible, horrible, horrible breakup," she said. "I f**ked up. I was an a**hole in my 20s, and I'll be the first to admit it. And that's kind of something that took me a long time to come out and be like, 'Yeah, you know what? I was a d**k,' and accept it. And I own it now."</p><p>Meanwhile, Culkin has never spoken of their relationship after they separated. However, he shared on the "Anna Faris Is Unqualified" podcast that <a href=#>being with Brenda Song</a> was the first time a partner had treated him well. "She just does nice things, and I feel like I'm almost, like, at first, I didn't know how to be treated well in that kind of way," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlZ4Vzf46mmJyZpaGuunnCrqOkoZ5iuqq4wGairqaZqHqou86dZK2doqLAbq3FrZyrZZKnsqK31Klm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
