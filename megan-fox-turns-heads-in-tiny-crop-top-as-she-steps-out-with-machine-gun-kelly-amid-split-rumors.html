The edgy look was completed with studded black trousers, a matching handbag, and towering platform heels, making Megan impossible to miss.</p><p id=eGWRRDVh7qs data-wc=41>Her beau, 33-year-old musician Machine Gun Kelly, also known as MGK, displayed his tattoo-covered arms proudly in a sleeveless, oversized gray suit.
