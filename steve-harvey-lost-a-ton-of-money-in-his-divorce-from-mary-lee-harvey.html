During an appearance on the podcast "<a href=#>Club Shay Shay</a>," Steve revealed that he had made over $30 million doing the "Kings of Comedy" tour but ended up with only $1,700 to his name after his <a href=#>marriage with Mary Lee Harvey ended</a>. When asked what happened, he responded, "It's called a divorce. I got jumped on, but it was even before the divorce."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>While he didn't name who scammed him, Steve also shared that someone close to him was taking money out of his bank account. "I was writing checks to the government for seven years, signing the tax checks, giving them to turn in," he explained. However, the individual was taking the money for themselves and he later realized he owed the government "seven years of unpaid taxes." During his divorce, he stated that millions of dollars were withdrawn from his account as well. "I was in a world of trouble, man. When I looked up, I had $1,700," Steve shared.</p><p dir=ltr>Following their divorce, Mary claimed Steve took their son Wynton from her and left her with nothing when in fact, she was given three homes, $40,000 per month until March 2009, and $1.5 million on top of that, per the <a href=#>Daily News</a>. Mary was ordered by a judge to refrain from talking about her divorce but after speaking out about Steve yet again, she found herself in jail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtoZYZyg46sq56ulWK1or7VnrBmpJ%2BowW7AzqdkqJ5doryvsdhmm6Kun6ewpnnMmqmyZZyasm60wKutnrFf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
