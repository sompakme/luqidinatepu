While McCarty received $538,729 from the Detroit Red Wings when they bought out his contract in 2005, according to <a href=#>ESPN</a>, his ex-wife, Cheryl, was granted $404,046 of that amount. McCarty opened up about his financial problems in a statement&nbsp;the following year,&nbsp;admitting, "It's obviously an embarrassing situation, but as with most things, there is more to it than what it seems."</p><p>McCarty may have been referring to his gambling debts, which he also discussed at the time. <a href=#>The Globe and Mail</a> reports that the former hockey player indulged in a high-stakes habit that resulted in him owing DMA Holdings $2 million, Huntington National Bank $1.5 million, and about $185,000 to various casinos.</p><p>These days, McCarty, who once dealt with serious alcohol-related issues, has gotten into the cannabis industry and hopes to find renewed success in the expanding field. "I'm all about championship teams," he told the&nbsp;<a href=#>Windsor Star</a>&nbsp;in September 2019. "I've got four Stanley Cups. They've got 45 Cannabis Cups ... I want to win a Cannabis Cup." Hopefully, for McCarty, that cup comes along with a cash prize.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampoaYZ5e8Ctn6WdpJrAbsPHqGSaqpVivbC70Z6pZqyYlrtuxc6uZK2gn6q0qcCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
