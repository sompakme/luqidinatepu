While there is no miracle cure, taking the right supplements can help promote hair growth and make your beard look fuller and healthier. Here are a few to consider:</p><h3>1. Biotin</h3><p class=align-left>Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin often touted as a <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1183915-latest-female-hairstyles.html href=#>natural hair</a> growth treatment.
