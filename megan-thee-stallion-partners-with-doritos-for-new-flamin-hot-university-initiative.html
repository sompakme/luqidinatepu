That is the Instagram <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a> used for her new brand partner, Frito Lay. More specifically, it is surrounding their Flamin' Hot lineup and their Doritos in particular. According to XXL, the Houston rapper has always been a big supporter of the brand and she was able to run a commercial with them during the 2022 Super Bowl.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That was with the Flamin' Hot Cheetos, but still more partnering down the line was possible, and now we are here. The reason that Megan is collaborating with Frito Lay once again, is for a pretty awesome reason. Being a Houston native, she attended college down in her hometown. She graduated from Texas Southern University, an HBCU, earning her bachelor's degree in health administration back in 2021. Just two years later, this campaign they are starting is a bit of a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">full-circle moment</a> for her.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-megan-is-flamin-hot-in-this-new-partnership-look>Megan Is Flamin' Hot In This New Partnership: Look</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to HipHopDX, you can purchase the special edition Flamin' Hot Doritos bags in-store or online at FlaminHotUniversity.com. On the site, you can take crash courses on cooking, style, and lifestyle. In addition there is merch you can purchase with items that include varsity jackets, sweaters, and more. Also, according to Hypebeast, it will give selected TSU graduating seniors a chance to help pay for some of their classes through a scholarship fund. Proceeds from merch sales will support the fund and help Megan give back to students looking to finish off college. It really is a great initiative, as she <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">continues to build her image</a> as well.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on Megan Thee Stallion teaming up with Flamin' Hot to help out HBCU students?
