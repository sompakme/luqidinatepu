But in a recent interview, the actress revealed that <strong>she's not a big fan of exercising</strong>. "I hate working out. It's boring!" she admitted. "I really only did it when I had a job that was physically demanding.

"Jess is an animal," choreography and one of Jessica's fitness trainers told Self magazine. "She works like crazy. She's still hungry to make it happen. You know that saying, 'You have just as many hours in the day as Beyoncé?' It's the same with Jessica. She just uses those hours better, too." Jessica also revealed that she prefers to keep her and her daughters Honor, 6, and Haven, 2, diets' clean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d8b4fd65504c-jessica-2-z.jpg><p id=ebC93x_HP1-n data-wc=8><strong>The actress prefers to keep her diet clean</strong></p><p id=erIPQlAwhzXV data-wc=77>"I have the same food philosophy for myself as I do for my kids," she said. "We eat mostly lean protein and fresh fruit and vegetables, nothing processed or from a box, if we can. "For me, when I don't eat a ton of carbs, I have more energy.
