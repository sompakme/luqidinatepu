"I didn't want a child of mine to be different or have fingers pointed at them. The marriage lasted for 10 years which was 10 years longer than it should have done."</p><p dir=ltr>Two years after she married her current husband, Peter, Sarah welcomed her third son, Joseph, in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Sarah is also a stepmum to Peter's three sons from his previous marriage to Penny Watt.
