When another fan asked her what kind of surgery, the she responded with, “I just want my titties pulled up cuz some of my tops don’t fit the way i want them to.”</p><p>During a recent cover story for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dazed</a>'s Winter 2022 issue, the 27-year-old revealed that had plans to get cosmetic surgery but her “hectic touring schedule” got in the way.</p><p>“Now, to me, beauty is going against it,” the Grammy Award-winning artist said. “I love when you take something that is maybe classically beautiful and twist it and make it your own. For me, it’s more of an ‘are you happy?’ kind of thing. I want my fans to learn they don’t have to be like anyone else and the thing they want is already there.”</p><p>She continued, “They just haven’t found it yet, and once they do they’ll be like, ‘How the fuck did I not see it? How did I miss this?’”</p><p>When a fan on Twitter sent her a screenshot of the statement, Doja Cat responded with, “They f**ked up the context completely.”</p><p>In 2018, Doja Cat did an interview with Vlad TV and stated that she didn't want "bigger boobs." “I got a lot of bad attention for a couple of photos that I posted on Instagram. They’re still up and it’s just me wearing a little chain bra, and I’m kinda leaned over, and it’s real natural," she said. "I just got a lot of like, ‘Saggy, saggy, saggy, saggy, saggy,’ all over the place. And it hurt my feelings of course, but I don’t give a fuck."</p><p>The "Say So" hitmaker continued, “Big boobs don’t [sit up]. So okay, about small boobs, small boobs don’t sag because they’re too small, there’s not enough skin and fat and boob there to sag. But with big boobs, there’s these boobs out here that are two basketballs and they don’t make sense. They defy gravity, they defy science, it’s unexplainable, it’s fucking, yeah. I don’t get it, I don’t get fake boobs.”</p><p>“I don’t think I would want bigger boobs than I have now, either. What’s so funny is my boobs look big sometimes and then I’ll be called flat-chested the next day. There’s people who think I’m flat-chested. I don’t know, I’m whatever, I don’t care,” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTcm5nm5%2BifKm702alnq%2BjZLGwtsBmmpqsXaeyt7HApapmqJyWu27Azmasp5yVp7SwecGrnJqrpGKutrPMnqWtmaSevK95yGahrqukYsSiutNmpLJlpJ7BtbXErGSprZyhsqV51Kk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
