On that occasion she even eschewed her usual ballet pumps for a pair of kitten-heeled Christian Louboutins, thereby ensuring they were in keeping with Letizia's signature towering heels.</p><p id=e6NWNeiDxk4a data-wc=27>A look at Carla's other fashion choices on official tours shows further evidence of the subtle style changes which put her firmly in sync with her peers.</p><p id=en27JCoy-hBs data-wc=64>When the former model welcomed the US president's wife <a class="linktextosub hm-link" href=#>Michelle Obama</a> to France at the start of April – her style of jacket – a knee skimming button up overcoat with a tie detail at the top – mirrored her US visitor's, even if the colour scheme did not. Carla opted for a classic fawn Dior number while Michelle chose a more edgy rose print design.</p><p id=eEzHLkmtPfLn data-wc=26>The Italian-born president's wife at one point even seemed to mirror Michelle's body language, as they both stood with their hands clasped in front of them.</p><p id=egRPJFFLYzJy data-wc=48>When Carla met Sonsoles Espinosa – wife of the Spanish PM - it was a similar story. Her trousers and a cropped jacket perfectly complemented the elegant Spaniard's silhouette. And she was also in harmony with Margarita Zavla – wife of the Mexican prime miniter, during their meeting.</p><p id=eOH51RHGGkdW data-wc=37>Both ladies wore skirt suits, though Carla still managed to inject her own personality by choosing an ensemble by her favourite design house in one of her favourite shades – a summery lavender hued number by Dior.</p><p id=eVuNk1H7D-hO data-wc=43>And the fashion resemblance was also unmistakable at an official function when Carla met French politician Rachida Dati – who hit headlines by returning to work days after giving birth. Carla's elegant floor length Dior number mirrored the raven-haired stateswoman's sweeping black gown.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
