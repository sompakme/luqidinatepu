The actress has been posting incendiary things on social media for months, and yesterday Lucasfilm confirmed that the MMA fighter-turned-actress is no longer a part of George Lucas’s beloved franchise. Much further out of left field, however, is the recent firing of popular Jackass star, Bam Margera. Nobody saw that coming, especially since he is one of the show’s biggest draws.</p><p>Skateboarder Bam Margera <a href=#>revealed on social media</a> that he has been fired from <a href=#>Jackass 4</a>. He also urged fans to boycott the film, saying, “If anybody cares about me don’t go see their movie.” His original post has now been deleted, but the video featured the skateboarder/stunt performer referring to himself as the “villain” the fourth film needs.</p><p>Steve-O updated fans on the upcoming film’s production a few months back but did not say anything about Bam Margera’s firing. Maybe this is a more recent development? Hopefully, we will learn more about what happened and see if his claims are even true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jackass-4-feature-900x506.jpg><p>Bam Margera, Steve-O, and the other members of the Jackass crew made names for themselves by performing outrageous – <a href=#>and usually disgusting</a> – stunts and pranks that shocked and awed countless fans for years. Inspired by the popular MTV show of the same name, the first three Jackass films were released between 2002 and 2010, with the Johnny Knoxville-led <a href=#>Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa</a> crashing and pranking its way theaters in 2013. Jackass 4 marks the first time in over a decade that a numbered Jackass movie has hit theaters. Without Bam, though, the energy this time around will undoubtedly be very, very different. <a href=#>According to MovieWeb</a>, the film is going to joke about the cast’s age, which is already a super different tone compared to its predecessors. Still, it is safe to assume that the crew will want to go bigger with this highly anticipated sequel, which will probably be fun (and more than a little bit alarming) to see.</p><p>Despite its insane popularity, the franchise has experienced more than a bit of controversy. Critics of the crew’s behavior cite the show’s dangerous antics in many of their arguments, even going as far as to blame the series for several deaths that occurred in the early 2000s. That is definitely an argument for a different day and another article, but it does bring into question the effectiveness of the show’s many, many “don’t try this at home” disclaimers.</p><p>It will be interesting to see if people come to Margera’s defense. I hadn’t heard his name in years before today, aside from the 2019 news that he had checked in to rehab. The reasons for his supposed forced departure aren’t clear, but the now-deleted social media video made it clear that Margera is upset by these new developments. Stay tuned for updates on this, because they will probably be coming soon!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jackass-4-900x600.jpg><p>Jackass 4 is currently scheduled for release on September 3, 2021. Hopefully, the pandemic does not force Paramount to delay this one, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iakaJ6rq3RoJyrmV2btrOxw2ahmpublsC0eZNmmaixk6TBtXrHraSl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
