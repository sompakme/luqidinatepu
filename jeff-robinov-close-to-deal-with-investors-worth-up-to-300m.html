He is said to be assembling that amount in various increments from interested parties. In addition to Chinese companies, he also is in talks with potential European investors and strategic partners.</p><p>“Jeff is trying to build a real production company, not just a slate of films, similar to what Legendary or Skydance have done,” said a source attending the Shanghai <a href=# id=auto-tag_international data-tag=international>International</a> Film Festival.</p><p>Robinov has declined to comment on ongoing negotiations due to the fluidity and complexity of such deals.</p><p>The original Huayi deal would have injected up to $150 million into Robinov’s Studio 8, which would have been one of the biggest China-Hollywood team-ups so far.</p><p>Robinov has also had talks with the e-commerce company Alibaba, which is about to go public in the biggest tech listing ever and is keen to expand its involvement in the film business. There have also been discussions with the L.A.- and Beijing-based production company DMG and the Chinese distribution and production outfit Bona.</p><p>An announcement that a deal was done had been widely expected at Cannes.</p><p><strong>VIDEOS&nbsp;<a href=#>Most Anticipated Summer Blockbusters</a></strong></p><p>Huayi Bros. was formed in 1994 and has grown into an entertainment conglomerate, with interests in film, TV, music, advertising and talent management.
