She stepped outside onto a quay with her husband and gently pulled the lobster from the container.</p><p>She appeared to stroke it and say a few words before plopping it into the placid waters of Golfo Aranci, a bay in the north of Sardinia that is close to the island’s exclusive Costa Smeralda coast. As soon as it hit the water, <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>it swam away</a>.</p><p>“The lady came into our restaurant and was straightaway struck by the aquarium that we have at the entrance,” said Antonio Fasolino, who owns the eatery with his brother Gianluca.</p><p>“She asked me if she could free the lobster and release it into the sea. At first I thought she was joking, but then I saw she was serious. I said, ‘for me that’s no problem!’”</p><p>He weighed the lobster in the kitchen and told the couple it cost €200. They promptly agreed to buy it.</p><p>The tourist insisted that she perform the act of liberation herself, rather than leave it to the restaurant staff.</p><p>“She wanted to do it as a sort of good deed. She seemed very touched and afterwards she hugged me,” said Mr Fasolino.</p><p>It was the largest lobster in the tank, hence the hefty price tag. “We placed it in a bucket and the lady released it into the sea while her husband took a video to record the moment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaK%2Bfp7mlec2erqxnYmV%2FdHuPcmZqcF%2BpvLa%2ByKyrZpyZo7KzedKaqZ2hnp6ubrLRnpysZWFsgm64zpuqrZ2iYruwwIyemK2hnpx8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
