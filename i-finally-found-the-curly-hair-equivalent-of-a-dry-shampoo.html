I can’t imagine myself without my ringletts, but taking care of them… woof. My curls are their own separate entity — they do what they want, when they want, and I am essentially powerless. I can exert small amounts of influence via certain techniques or products, but that’s it. The most frustrating aspect of this is that there is no such thing as a curly hair <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dry shampoo</a>; if I want to revive my curls my only option is to rinse or wash them. It’s tiring and tedious, but less so now that I have found a solution thanks to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Eva Nyc’s $16 H2-Whoa! Hydration Leave-In Conditioner</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Technically, per the name, this is a leave-in conditioner. It’s rich in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>collagen</a> which are supposed to, according to the brand, provide similar results for your hair as they do for your face. Namely, you’ll see intense hydration, plumping, and strengthening effects, especially if your hair is on the coarser and drier side.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>My discovery of its use as a dry shampoo replacement was a result of laziness and frustration. I woke up with my hair in a bun and wanted to get ready for the day quickly while still looking cute. I simply did not have it in me to take a shower and restyle my curls. I looked around the shelf where I keep my to-try products and figured what the hell, it has a spray nozzle, which makes it easy to apply, so let’s give it a go. I sprayed it all over my hair to the point where it was slightly dampened, focusing on the areas that had gone flat and lifeless overnight. Afterwards, I scrunched my strands and put it up in a clip while I got dressed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I released my hair from the clip, I was pleasantly surprised that my curls were back — they were bouncy, defined, and nourished. It was like I had done the usual 20-minute rinse, style, and dry routine, but it had taken me less than five instead.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since discovering <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Eva Nyc’s H2-Whoa! Hydration Leave-In Conditioner</a> and its off-label use, I have been spritzing it on my hair at least three times a week. It has the consistency of water, dries without stickiness or crunchiness, and has given me hours of my life back. I’ve been using it incredibly liberally (there’s no such thing as too much with this formula), but I’m not stressed about it since a bottle is a mere $16.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shop the Ulta-exclusive <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Eva Nyc H2-Whoa!
