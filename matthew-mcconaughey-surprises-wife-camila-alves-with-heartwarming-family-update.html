Matthew, 53, wore a cap and sunglasses, and as he began the video, he offered advice by revealing that "romance is not so much where you are but what the tunes are where you are and who you're with".&nbsp;</p><p id=erfbYIBKiI data-wc=53>"Right now I am here on a cozy little bench with my hot mamma, our playlist is playing out loud underneath the canopy in front of the lobby…. happy anniversary baby," he said. But the date had gone unnoticed by Camila, <strong>whose face dropped when she realized it was their 11th wedding anniversary.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eceNMplNQv data-wc=39>Camila, the mother of Matthew's three sons, later reposted the video and quipped: "You know…We are sooo romantic…… while a lot of folks [post] their extravagant anniversaries, roses, gifts, etc… We are sitting on a bench heading to work.&nbsp;</p><p id=etlB19vaUj data-wc=49>"Well… do YOU whatever way it is!
