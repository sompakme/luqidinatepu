Speaking to E!, Halliwell-Horner offered up some very cute Spicy nicknames she'd give to Kim K. —&nbsp;and they're as empowering as you'd hope for a mom, mogul, and reality royalty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She deserves something really good," Halliwell-Horner&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told E! News</a>.&nbsp;"She deserves something like Inner Strength Spice. I think she's Smart Spice. She's smart. It's brilliant that you're beautiful from the outside, but also she's beautiful with a book in her back pocket. I love that. We can all be things. Good for her!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halliwell-Horner also spoke about how proud she is of Kim for embracing her body and also being a successful — and inspiring&nbsp;— businesswoman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's amazing," Geri added.

"I mean, I'm sure she was joking. But like, when I was in high school, would I ever have thought that this was, like, a thing?
