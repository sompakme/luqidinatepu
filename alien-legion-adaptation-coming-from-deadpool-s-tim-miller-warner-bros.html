It became the line’s longest-running title, even outliving the imprint when it was moved to other publishers in the 21st century. Alan Zelenetz and Frank Cirocco are the other co-creators.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Described as “the French Foreign Legion in space,” the stories focused on a intergalactic peace-keeping force that took in all manner of species without asking too many questions about their pasts or intentions, operating within an unwieldly government system known as the Galactic Union that is straining to be a democratic melting pot. Prejudice and bad intentions abound and struggle with well-intentioned idealists</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Among the key characters are Sarigar, a captain from a serpent-like species that were once used as slave labor; the brutish degenerate Juger Grimrod, with his green skin and deep hostility towards authority; the gentle four-armed medic, Meico; and Torie Montroc, a human who is being forced to do a tour of duty in the Legion in order to receive his inheritance.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Hollywood has flirted with adapting the comics, with its Star Wars and Star Trek tones, for over two decades. Angry Films briefly it set up at Dimension Films in the early 2000s, although the genre arm of then mighty Miramax could never mount the budget necessary to translate something that amounts to an event film to the big-screen.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer set up the property at Disney later in the 2000s and had scripts written by David Benioff (Game of Thrones), and 3:10 to Yuma’s Derek Haas and Michael Brandt. Eventually the rights reverted to Potts, who continued to find the right home for his pulpy concept.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Warner Bros. Pictures Group co-chair and CEO <a href=# id=auto-tag_michael-de-luca_1 data-tag=michael-de-luca>Michael De Luca</a> is a a fan of the title and had pursued it for several years. Miller, too, is a long time fan, with Legion being a comic he had pursued when he had been an animator earlier in his career.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Miller, who is currently prepping revenge flick Best Served Cold with Rebecca Ferguson as his next project, is repped by WME and Johnson Shapiro.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Murphy and Monford are developing a multi-medium take on classic sci-fi title Buck Rogers and are also making new version of cult horror movie Faces of Death.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Potts was repped on the deal by Blain and Associates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKK4yJ6lZqSVnLawuoyam5qopJbBqrvNZpuemZSlvLC4jK2gpmWdnrmtsdFmrpqqnpq%2Fbq7RqKpmaWJogneAlXFobmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
