But that crazy dress … and I talk about it in the book, why did I wear that?&nbsp;That was my first public appearance after being sexually assaulted,” she told Oz. “I was like, ‘Is that what you want?'” At the time, the dress, which was essentially a thong bikini covered by a shimmery string of beads, was viewed as an attempt by McGowan to flaunt her assets alongside the goth rocker. But McGowan said that was not at all her intention.</p><p>“I’ve never worn something like that before or since,” she explained. “That was a political statement. … Of course, there was no Twitter at the time or Instagram, no way to speak for yourself.” (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Click here</a>&nbsp;to watch a&nbsp;clip off the&nbsp;Oz&nbsp;interview.) McGowan has made a series of talk show&nbsp;appearances this week promoting the book, including a contentious book signing on Wednesday night in New York, at which she reportedly got into a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>shouting match</a>&nbsp;with a trans woman about one of McGowan’s earlier comments regarding violence against the trans community.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async width=928 height=1399 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marilyn_manson_and_rose_mcgowan_embed.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>She later claimed in an interview with writer Ronan Farrow on Thursday that she thought the heckler was a “paid plant. … I had people watching the exchange, how it handed off”; she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a>&nbsp;later in the day that she would be canceling all future public appearances. “I have given beauty, in return I was VERBALLY ASSAULTED for two full minutes @BNBuzz by an actor paid to verbally assault&nbsp;a woman who has been terrorized by your system,” she wrote.</p><p>She also told Farrow that there is another “very famous” Hollywood predator she is not yet ready to unmask, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “This man picked me up when I was 15 years old,” she said. “He took me home after he met me and he showed me a soft porn movie he had made for Showtime, under a different name. And then he had sex with me.”</p><p>This story first appeared on <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLO70p5kppuXpMSiuoysmLKrXZ6wsLrInGSsnZViw66t0mabq52jqHq4rdJmqp6boprBbrTAq62esV2ssqq60q2coqZdpb%2BwwMSsq2ZpYG1%2BdIWXaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
